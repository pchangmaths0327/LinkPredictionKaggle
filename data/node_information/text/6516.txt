   Easy Taco Bell Copycat Breakfast Crunch
   Ingredients
     * 1 egg mixed with 3 teaspoons milk
     * Salt and pepper to taste
     * 1 teaspoon butter
     * 3 pieces fried bacon crumbled
     * 1 slice frozen hash brown patties
     * 1 12 inch flour tortilla warmed

   Instructions
    1. Fry bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towel and set aside.
    2. To warm hash brown: Pour a little oil onto a frying pan. Transfer
       your hash browns onto the pan. Don't use low heat. After about 3
       minutes, turn them once and keep frying until a golden brown. Leave
       in pan to keep warm.
    3. To fix tortilla: Over medium-high heat, in a small sauce pan, place
       tortilla in small amount of oil, brown on both sides. Remove from
       pan and set aside.
    4. After tortilla is warmed, use same pan to scramble eggs.
    5. To Scramble eggs: Beat egg, milk, salt and pepper in medium bowl
       until blended.
    6. Heat 1 teaspoon butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until
       hot. Pour in egg mixture and the crumbled fried bacon. As eggs
       begin to set, Gently pull the eggs across the pan with a spatula,
       forming large soft curds. Continue cooking – pulling, lifting and
       folding eggs – until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.
    7. Put together: Lay tortilla flat. Place hash brown on top, then the
       scrambled egg. Fold the tortilla over the hash brown and scramble
       egg.

     * 4 teaspoons baking powder
     * 1/2 teaspoon salt
     * 1 tablespoon sugar
     * 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
     * 1/2 cup cold butter diced

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have seen lots of people posting about that feeling
   of the first cold coming on. Allergies are ba<span
   class="text_exposed_show">d too! Makes for a sore throat in the morning
   especially! <strong>A sore throat is usually the first sigh of a cold
   coming on.</strong></span></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> If you wake up
   with a <strong>sore throat</strong>, and begin to feel a cold coming
   on, mix hot water, 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider
   Vinegar, a dash of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Mix well
   and drink. You will feel better within the hour. Works every time!</p>
   <p><strong>2. Stay hydrated</strong>. Water, juice, clear broth or warm
   lemon water with honey helps loosen congestion and prevents
   dehydration.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Rest</strong>. Your
   body needs to heal.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Sip warm liquids. Like
   <strong>Lemon Tea</strong>:</p> <ul id="simple-list_1-0" class="comp
   text-passage simple-list simple-list--bulleted "><li
   class="simple-list__item js-checkbox-trigger
   ingredient"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></li> <li
   class="simple-list__item js-checkbox-trigger ingredient">4 tea
   bags</li> <li class="simple-list__item js-checkbox-trigger
   ingredient">2 teaspoons of grated lemon peel</li> <li
   class="simple-list__item js-checkbox-trigger ingredient">1 teaspoon
   lemon juice</li> <li class="simple-list__item js-checkbox-trigger
   ingredient">4 cups&nbsp;boiling water</li> <li id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-1"
   class="comp mntl-sc-block-group--LI mntl-sc-block
   mntl-sc-block-startgroup"> <div id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-2" class="comp
   mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">
   <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p> <p>Boil water.&nbsp; Add lemon
   peel, lemon juice, and tea bags. Allow steeping for 10 minutes.Serve
   hot and add milk or sugar. For a variation, try adding vanilla
   sugar!</p> </div> </li> </ul><p><strong>5.</strong> Add moisture to the
   air with a cool mist <strong>vaporizer or humidifier</strong>.</p>
   <p><strong>6.</strong> If you have a sore throat, gargle with
   <strong>warm salt water</strong>. 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt dissolved in
   an 8-ounce glass of warm water.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Up your
   <strong>Vitamin C,</strong> with OTC capsules or foods high in Vitamin
   C:&nbsp; Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Lemons. Lychees, American
   Persimmons and Strawberries.It appears that for the most part
   taking&nbsp;vitamin C&nbsp;won&rsquo;t&nbsp;help&nbsp;the average
   person prevent&nbsp;colds. However, taking&nbsp;vitamin C&nbsp;before
   the onset of&nbsp;cold symptoms may shorten the duration of
   symptoms.&nbsp; The RDA or recommended daily allowance is 90 mg for men
   and 75 mg for women.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> Eat<strong> chicken
   soup</strong>. Chicken soup has been recommended as a remedy for the
   common cold for hundreds of years, and for good reason. It&rsquo;s an
   easy-to-eat source of vitamins, minerals, calories and protein, which
   are nutrients your body needs in larger quantities while you&rsquo;re
   sick.</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Eat <strong>Oranges</strong>. Oranges
   are packed with vitamin C, an essential nutrient when you&rsquo;re
   feeling under the weather.</p> <p><strong>10.</strong> Put Vicks
   <strong>VapoRub</strong> on your feet and cover with a towel or
   socks.&nbsp; Vicks VapoRub is a topical cough medication that is
   applied to the skin to treat coughs and applied to muscles to relieve
   aches and pain. Both symptoms are frequently caused by the common cold.
   Or Apply topically to the chest or neck for cough relief that starts
   working instantly.</p> <p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Break up
   mucus</strong> by rubbing a bit of camphor or menthol salve around
   &ndash; not in! &ndash; your nose. You can also reduce congestion by
   breathing in aromatherapy oils, such as peppermint and eucalyptus.</p>
   <p><strong>12.</strong> A <strong>steamy shower</strong> or sauna is a
   great decongestant. One caution: If you are dizzy or weak from the flu,
   sit in a chair in your bathroom while you run a hot shower.</p>
   <p><strong>13.</strong> To help your sinuses drain, sleep with an
   <strong>extra pillow under your head</strong>.</p>
   <p><strong>14.</strong> To <strong>soothe a sore throat</strong>, steep
   two teaspoons of shredded ginger in a cup of hot water (if you prefer
   something cool, use a cup of sparkling water). Drink at least 2-3 cups
   a day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See

   100vw, 600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why eat
   cabbage:</strong></p> <p>Cabbage is high in fiber and contains powerful
   antioxidants, including polyphenols and sulfur compounds. Cabbage is
   especially high in vitamin C, a potent antioxidant that may protect
   against heart disease, certain cancers and vision loss. It is also low
   in calories.</p> <p>Cabbage contains powerful antioxidants that may
   help reduce inflammation. It will improve your digestive health because
   of it&rsquo;s high fiber content. Red Cabbage is high in potassium and
   may help reduce your blood pressure.</p> <p>Cabbage is a good source of
   soluble fiber and plant steroids. These substances have been shown to
   reduce LDL cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>Ways to cook cabbage and
   recipes:</strong></p> <p>1. Cut a couple of heads into small wedges,
   splash with a good oil (I use avocado) and pink salt and roast in a 400
   degree oven until the wedges are soft and lightly browned. It
   caramelizes a bit. It&rsquo;s delicious.</p> <p>2. Sauteed in olive oil
   and garlic.</p> <p>3. Slow simmer some smoked turkey necks in water or
   chicken broth for a couple of hours and then add cabbage for the last
   30 mins or until it reaches your desired tenderness. You eat the turkey
   meat with cabbage for a meal.</p> <p>4. Slice an onion shaved garlic
   saute in olive oil and butter. Cube the cabbage and saute together. Add
   more butter as needed. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p> <div

   </p><div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients"> <h4>Crust:</h4>
   <ul><li>2 cups sifted all purpose flour</li> <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>2/3 cup shortening</li> <li>5 to 7 Tablespoons cold water</li>
   <li>Ground cinnamon and granulated sugar to taste for topping.</li>
   </ul><h4>Peach Filling:</h4> <ul><li>2 cans (1 lb 13 oz) sliced
   peaches, in syrup or juice</li> <li>1 can condensed milk</li> <li>1 cup
   brown sugar</li> <li>1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon</li> <li>2 teaspoons
   ground nutmeg</li> <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> <li>1 teaspoon
   lemon extract</li> <li>2/3 stick butter</li> <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
   </ul><h4>Dumpling dough:</h4> <ul><li>3 3/4 cups self-rising flour</li>
   <li>1/2 cups shortening</li> <li>1/2 cup cold water (add a little at a
   time)</li> </ul></div> <div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions">
   <h4>Crust:</h4> <ol><li>Sift together flour and salt. Cut in shortening
   with pastry blender or blending fork until pieces are the size of small
   peas.</li> <li>To make pastry extra tender and flaky, divide shortening
   in half. Cut in first half until mixture looks like corn meal. Then cut
   in remaining half until looks like small peas.</li> <li>Sprinkle 1
   Tablespoon of the water over part of the flour mixture. Gently toss
   with a fork; push to one side of bowl.</li> <li>Sprinkle next
   Tablespoon water over dry part; mix lightly; push to moistened part at
   side. Repeat until all is moistened. Gather up with fingers; form into
   ball. Divide dough for upper and lower crust. Form each in ball.</li>
   <li>On a lightly floured surface roll out 1 of the balls. Flatten ball
   sightly and roll 1/8 inch thick. If edges split, pinch together. Always
   roll dough from center to edge. Using light strokes.</li> <li> <p>To
   transfer pastry, roll it over rolling pin; unroll pastry over
   9&times;13 inch baking pan, fitting loosely onto bottom and sides. Trim
   1/2 to 1 inch beyond edge; fold under and flute. DO NOT prick pastry.
   </p> </li> <li>Roll out the other pastry ball and cut into lattice
   shape. Set aside.</li> </ol><h4>To make the peach filling:</h4>
   <ol><li> <p>In a large pot, combine the peaches and syrup/juice,, brown
   sugar, condensed milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, lemon extract, salt
   and butter. Over medium heat, cover and bring mixture to a boil;
   stirring occasionally to ensure butter and seasonings are well
   dispersed. Cook for approximately 15 minutes.</p> </li>
   </ol><h4>Dumpling Dough:</h4> <ol><li>While the peaches are cooking,
   prepare the dumpling dough. Sift the flour in a medium or large bowl.
   Cut the shortening into the flour until you get a mealy consistency.
   Gradually add the cold water, mixing just until the dough holds
   together. Do not add too much water. Knead lightly 4 to 5 times.</li>
   <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough very thinly (no thicker
   than about 1/4&Prime; thick). Cut into 2 to 2 1/2 inch wide strips;
   then cut each strip diagonally into even pieces.</li> <li> <p>Place
   enough strips of dough into the boiling peach mixture to cover and
   press them down into the juice. Cook those strips for approximately 7
   minutes. Repeat the process (of adding dough strips) and cook until all
   of the dough has been used up. Cook until the dumplings look
   translucent and start to settle into the juice and the juice
   thickens.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</p> </li>
   <li>Place the mixture into the prepared pie crust.</li> <li>Add the
   lattice to the top.</li> <li> <p>Sprinkle Cinnamon and Sugar on top, to
   taste</p> </li> <li> <p>Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden
   brown.</p> </li> </ol></div> <div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-notes">
   <p>For an <strong>easier version of the dumplings</strong> you can use
   1 can of canned biscuits. Just fry the biscuits in 2 teaspoons
   vegetable oil. Brown on both sides and then turn down heat, cooking
   until done. Remove from pan and place on paper towel to drain. Cut into
   fourths and drop into peach mixture. Continue with recipe
   above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You could also use canned rolled dough
   instead of making your own pie crust.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div>

   sugar</li> <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li> <li>1/2 cup unsalted

   milk or buttermilk</li> </ul><h4>Caramel Frosting:</h4> <ul><li>1/2 cup
   salted butter</li> <li>1 cup packed dark brown sugar</li> <li>1/3 cup
   heavy cream</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> <li>2 to 3 cups powdered

   salt</li> <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> </ul></div> <div
   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"> <h4>Caramel Cupcakes:</h4>
   <ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li> <li>Line 12-cup muffin pan
   with paper liners. Set aside.</li> <li>In a large bowl, whisk together
   the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li> <li>In a separate medium bowl,
   beat the butter and sugars together at medium-high speed until light
   and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla. Beat until
   combined.</li> <li>Slowly mix in the dry ingredients, scraping down the
   sides of the bowl as needed. Slowly stir in the milk. Do not over mix
   the batter.</li> <li>Fill each cupcake liner only 1/2 way full with
   batter. Bake cupcakes for 22-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
   in the center of the cupcake comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool
   before frosting, about 1 hour.</li> </ol><h4>Caramel Frosting:</h4>
   <ol><li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan.</li> <li>Once melted, add
   brown sugar and heavy cream.</li> <li>Stir constantly over medium heat
   until sugar is dissolved. Add salt. Allow to bubble for 3 full minutes,
   no more.</li> <li>Remove from heat and allow to slightly cool, only
   about 15 minutes.</li> <li>With a hand mixer at medium speed, beat in
   powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, until you reach desired consistency.
   Add a little heavy cream if you&rsquo;d like the frosting a little
   creamier or thinner.</li> <li>Add more salt if the frosting tastes too
   sweet.</li> <li>Frost cooled cupcakes and adorn with salted caramel
   crack candies.</li> </ol><h4>Caramel Crack Candy Topping:</h4>
   <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 400 Line a 10&times;15-inch cookie sheet
   with nonstick aluminum foil or regular heavy duty foil, making sure
   that the foil completely covers the bottom and sides of the pan. If
   using regular foil, spray lightly with baking spray. Line the saltine
   crackers in a single layer on the bottom.</li> <li>Start making the
   caramel-like sauce by placing the brown sugar, butter and salt in a
   medium sized saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring frequently, until
   the butter melts. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for another
   3 to 5 minutes, just until the mixture comes to a boil and starts to
   darken. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li> <li>Pour
   the hot brown sugar mixture over the saltine crackers. Spread to evenly
   coat the crackers.Move the pan to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. The
   caramel will be hot and bubbly.</li> <li>Let the crackers cool to room
   temperature then move to the refrigerator and cool over night. The
   crackers will form a single sheet once cool. Remove from pan and gently
   peel the foil away, being careful not to tear the foil. Cut the candy
   into small sized pieces, or crack it with your hands.</li> <li>Place on
   top of cupcakes.</li> </ol></div> <div

   Transfer the cooked broccoli to a medium size bowl and set aside.</li>
   <li>In the same skillet you cooked the broccoli, heat another
   tablespoon of olive oil, and cook the chicken in an even layer. Season
   with salt and pepper. Cook about 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is
   golden brown and cooked thoroughly, turning the chicken several times.
   Transfer the cooked chicken to the same bowl as the broccoli.</li>
   <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter, then cook the garlic for 30
   seconds, or until fragrant. Add the heavy cream, and scrape up any
   brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add the grated Parmesan
   cheese, and cook until melted and just starting to bubble. Turn the
   heat to low.</li> <li>When the pasta is done cooking, reserve 1 cup of
   the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta from the water, then add the
   cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce, and toss to coat the
   noodles. Add in the cooked chicken and broccoli, toss to combine. If
   necessary, add in pasta water to thin the sauce to desired
   consistency.</li> <li>Serve warm, topped with grated Parmesan
   cheese.</li> </ol></div> <div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-notes">

   specifications I have to meet to shape her?&rdquo;</p> <p>She must
   function on all kinds of situations,<br> She must be able to embrace
   several kids at the same time,<br> Have a hug that can heal anything

   hands&hellip;..impossible!</p> <p>And this is the standard
   model?&rdquo;</p> <p>The Angel came closer and touched the
   woman&rdquo;<br> &ldquo;But you have made her so soft, Lord&rdquo;.<br>
   &ldquo;She is soft&rdquo;, said the Lord,<br> &ldquo;But I have made
   her strong. You can&rsquo;t imagine what she can endure and
   overcome&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Can she think?&rdquo; The Angel
   asked&hellip;<br> The Lord answered. &ldquo;Not only can she think, she

   cheeks&hellip;.<br> &ldquo;Lord, it seems this creation is leaking! You
   have put too many burdens on her&rdquo;<br> &ldquo;She is not
   leaking&hellip;it is a tear&rdquo; The Lord corrected the
   Angel&hellip;</p> <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo; Asked the
   Angel&hellip;.. .<br> The Lord said. &ldquo;Tears are her way of
   expressing her grief, her doubts, her love, her loneliness, her
   suffering and her pride.&rdquo;&hellip;</p> <p>This made a big
   impression on the Angel,<br> &ldquo;Lord, you are a genius. You thought
   of everything.<br> A woman is indeed marvelous&rdquo;</p> <p>Lord
   said.&rdquo;Indeed she is.<br> She has strength that amazes a man.<br>
   She can handle trouble and carry heavy burdens.<br> She holds
   happiness, love and opinions.<br> She smiles when she feels like
   screaming.<br> She sings when she feels like crying, cries when happy
   and laughs when afraid.<br> She fights for what she believes in.</p>
   <p>Her love is unconditional.<br> Her heart is broken when a
   next-of-kin or a friend dies but she finds strength to get on with
   life&rdquo;</p> <p>The Angel asked: So she is a perfect being?<br> The
   lord replied: No. <strong>She has just one
   drawback</strong><br><strong>&ldquo;She often forgets what she is

   <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (softened)</li>

   temperature)</li> </ul><h4>For the Coconut Buttercream Frosting:</h4>
   <ul><li>2 8 oz package cream cheese (softened)</li> <li>1 cup butter or
   margarine (softened)</li> <li>6 tablespoons milk</li> <li>2 teaspoon
   vanilla extract</li> <li>2 16 oz package powdered sugar (sifted)</li>
   <li>2 7 oz package sweetened flaked coconut</li> </ul></div> <div
   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"> <h4>For The Cake:</h4>
   <ol><li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.</li> <li> <p>Grease two 9-inch cake
   pans or three 8-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease
   the parchment paper.</p> </li> <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa
   powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li> <li>Using a
   handheld mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed
   until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom
   of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks,
   vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the
   egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl
   with a rubber spatula as needed.</li> <li>With the mixer on low speed,
   add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the
   buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until
   combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or
   beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured
   above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter.</li> <li>Divide
   batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of
   the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in
   the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as
   determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However,
   careful not to over bake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from
   the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes
   must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
   </ol><h4>For The Coconut Buttercream Frosting:</h4> <ol><li>Beat cream
   cheese and butter at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy;
   add milk and vanilla, beating well. Gradually add sugar, beating until
   smooth. Stir in coconut.</li> <li>Frost cooled cake.</li> </ol></div>

   vanilla extract</li> <li>1 tablespoon milk</li> </ul></div> <div
   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"> <h4>For the donuts:</h4>
   <ol><li>Place the warm water in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast
   evenly over the water to dissolve. When it has bubbled (proofed), add
   the milk, sugar, salt, egg, shortening, and 1 cup of the flour.</li>
   <li>Beat the mixture on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the
   bowl as needed, for about 2 minutes.</li> <li>Stir in the remaining
   flour by hand until the dough is smooth.</li> <li>Cover the dough with
   a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about
   1 hour.</li> <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Pat it
   flat then roll it out with a rolling pin until it is 1/2-inch
   thick.</li> <li>Cut the dough with round cookie cutters. Place the
   cutouts, evenly spaced, on floured baking sheets and let rise in a
   warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30-40 minutes.</li>
   </ol><h4>While the donuts are rising, make the vanilla filling:</h4>
   <ol><li>In a mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and butter
   until smooth and blended. Gradually add the confectioners&rsquo; sugar
   (1/2 cup at a timwith the mixer running. Add the vanilla and milk and
   beat the filling until light and fluffy. The filling can be stored up
   to 2 weeks in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li> <li>When
   the donuts have risen, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F in a
   deep fryer or Dutch oven.</li> <li>Carefully slide the dough into the
   hot oil. Turn the doughnuts as they brown, they should cook for about 1
   minute per side. Do this in batches as needed making sure to keep the
   oil at 350 degrees F.</li> <li>Carefully remove the browned donuts from
   the oil with a slotted metal spoon. Set on a rack to drain.</li>
   <li>When the donuts are cool, using a sharp, narrow knife, carefully
   create a pocket inside the donuts to hold the filling.</li> <li>Fill a
   pastry bag with a plain tip with the vanilla filling. Insert the tip
   into the hole of the donuts and gently, but generously, fill with the
   cream filling.</li> <li>Dust the filled donuts with additional
   confectioners&rsquo; sugar</li> </ol></div> <div

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Loving a drug addict or an active alcoholic is the
   hardest thing you will ever do.</p> <p>Watching someone you love, that
   has fought so hard to beat addiction, throw everything away and sink
   back into a life that will most likely lead to jail or death, is one of
   the hardest things you will ever do.</p> <p>All you wanted was to help
   them back to a clean and sober life but you realize by doing this, as
   you have so many times before, will now just be enabling them because
   it will show them th<span class="text_exposed_show">at you will always
   be there to bail them out. </span></p> <p><span
   class="text_exposed_show">You want to grab and shake them and say
   &ldquo;What are you doing?!?!&rdquo; But, at some point you realize
   that it wouldn&rsquo;t make a difference. So you sit back and watch the
   tragedy unfold, as if you are watching a movie. </span></p> <p><span
   class="text_exposed_show">Feeling helpless to stop it, feeling like you
   haven&rsquo;t done enough to help, even though you know only the addict
   can help themselves.</span></p> <p><span class="text_exposed_show"><br>
   Battling a drug and/or an alcohol addiction is a beast for the person
   addicted and the ones who love them.</span></p> <p>Helping a loved one
   struggling with drug or alcohol addiction is often a long and
   heartbreaking journey. At times, it can be so overwhelming that
   ignoring the situation may seem like an easier solution.</p>
   <p>Sweeping the issue under the rug can be more damaging to you, your
   family, and the person you&rsquo;re concerned about. As painful as it
   may be, it&rsquo;s important that you take the time to encourage your
   loved one to get the help they need.</p> <p>Although you may see this
   as selfish, it&rsquo;s incredibly important that you&rsquo;re able to
   be there for others and make the best decisions possible.<strong> Make
   sure your own needs are met</strong> by getting enough sleep,
   exercising, and eating well. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go to therapy to
   get help if you find yourself struggling due to your loved one&rsquo;s
   drug addiction.</p> <p><strong>My story:</strong></p> <p>20 years ago
   my husband was an alcoholic. Other than the drinking he was the perfect
   man. Kind, loving, gentle&nbsp; and generous.&nbsp; But I could not
   live with the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; side of him. I gave him a choice. It
   was either me or the alcohol and prayed he would choose me. I stood my
   ground, even though it was VERY hard on both of us. On a couple
   occasions I threw him out of the house. It was a two year battle. But
   WE finally won. He has been alcohol free for 18 years now. He ended up
   loving me more that the alcohol. We are so very happy now. <strong>The
   answer is</strong>: that I did not enable him and stuck to my guns.
   Tough LOVE and PRAYERS do work. I am not telling you that it will work
   with your loved one, but if they can not change then you are better off
   without them. <strong>You must take care of yourself
   first!&nbsp;</strong>You can not help anyone who will not help
   themselves.</p> <p><span class="text_exposed_show">So l am asking you
   to stand with me in prayer for every family member and friend who has
   lost or is losing their battle with drugs and alcohol and those who
   continue to conquer it!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>A Friend&rsquo;s

   the last $60 I had on pills to get high- instead of buying my baby
   Diapers or giving it to my kids before I checked int<span
   class="text_exposed_show">o a Detox Center. A few months before that on
   Christmas Eve 2015, my girlfriend left me and took my kids, I lost
   everything including my soul. I was told I was a worthless junkie, that
   I should kill myself, that I&rsquo;d never make it. They said my life
   would never change, that I would always be the same old
   Randall.</span></p> <div class="text_exposed_show"> <p>But
   &ldquo;They&rdquo; were wrong.</p> <p>Today by The Amazing Grace of God
   I have 3 years of recovery. 1,096 days that I have let God lead me 24
   hours at a time. I have 3 amazing and beautiful babies. I am a Father,
   a Son, a Brother, an Uncle, and a Friend. The Director of Addiction
   Recovery Care&rsquo;s Ashland Outpatient Center, a College Degree and
   working towards a Bachelor in Social Work Degree at Morehead State
   University. And I&rsquo;m not done yet!</p> <p>3 years ago I
   couldn&rsquo;t go 1 minute without wanting to get high. I had thoughts
   of killing my self daily, however, was too big of a coward to do it. I
   would go to my Sisters grave daily, praying for God to take my life
   because I hated who I was and had lost everything. If I could describe
   my life for 12 and a half years in a quote it would be this:</p>
   <p>&ldquo;The reason why many are still troubled, still seeking, still
   making little forward progress is because they haven&rsquo;t yet come
   to the end of themselves. We&rsquo;re still trying to give orders, and
   interfering with God&rsquo;s work within us.&rdquo;<br> ~ A. W.
   Tozer~</p> <p>But the best thing about this life is that it can change
   in one moment. Don&rsquo;t sit around and wait for it to happen. Stand
   up and be the change. Be your own hero.</p> <p>To any person who is
   addicted: You are not just a Junkie, a Nobody, you have a grand
   purpose. You are built from every mistake you have ever made. You are
   not too far gone, too hopeless, too unforgiven, to have a new life. You
   deserve recovery, you deserve to truly live. You are A Child of
   God!</p> <p>Today, I woke up happy to be alive. I looked in the mirror
   and respected the man staring back at me. Today, I know of freedom and
   what it means to be alive. Not because of anything I have done but
   because I surrendered my life to the Lord and let him take control. I
   give all Glory to Him.</p> <p>Faith will tell you to have patience when
   everything else is telling you to panic.<br> Faith will tell you to
   hold on when everything else is telling you to let go.<br> Faith will
   tell you to push forward when everything else is telling you to pull
   back.</p> <p>Choose freedom and recovery for yourself too. Call <a

   style="text-align: left;"><strong>AND THEN IT IS
   WINTER&nbsp;</strong><br> You know time has a way of moving quickly and
   catching you unaware of the passing years. It seems like yesterday that
   I was young, just married, and embarking on my new life with my mate.
   Yet in a way, it seems like eons ago and I wonder where all those years
   went.</p> <p>I know that I lived them all. I have glimpses of how it
   was back then and of all my hopes and dreams. But, here it is&hellip;
   the winter of my life, and it catches me by surprise&hellip; How did I
   get here so fast? Where did the years go and where did my youth go? I
   remember well seeing older people through the years and thinking that
   those &ldquo;older people&rdquo; were years away from me and that
   winter was so far off that I could not fathom it or imagine fully what
   it would be like.</p> <p>But, here it is&hellip;my friends are retired
   and getting grey&hellip; they move slower and I see an older person in
   myself now. Some are in better and some worse shape than me&hellip;
   but, I see the great change&hellip; Not like the ones that I remember
   who were young and vibrant&hellip;but, like me, their age is beginning
   to show and we are now those older folks that we used to see and never
   thought we&rsquo;d be.</p> <p>Each day now, I find that just getting a
   shower is a real target for the day! And taking a nap is not a treat
   anymore&hellip; it&rsquo;s mandatory! Cause if I don&rsquo;t on my own
   free will&hellip; I just fall asleep where I sit!</p> <p>And so&hellip;
   now I enter this new season of my life unprepared for all the aches and
   pains and the loss of strength and ability to go and do things that I
   wish I had done but never did!! But, at least I know, that though the
   winter has come, and I&rsquo;m not sure how long it will last&hellip;
   this I know, that when it&rsquo;s over on this earth&hellip; it&rsquo;s
   over. A new adventure will begin!</p> <p>Yes, I have regrets. There are
   things I wish I hadn&rsquo;t done&hellip; things I should have done,
   but indeed, there are also many things I&rsquo;m happy to have done.
   It&rsquo;s all in a lifetime.</p> <p>So, if you&rsquo;re not in your
   winter yet&hellip; let me remind you, that it will be here faster than
   you think. So, whatever you would like to accomplish in your life,
   please do it quickly! Don&rsquo;t put things off too long!! Life goes
   by quickly. So, do what you can TODAY, as you can never be sure whether
   this is your winter or not!</p> <p>You have no promise that you will
   see all the seasons of your life&hellip; so, LIVE FOR TODAY and say all
   the things that you want your loved ones to remember.. and hope that
   they appreciate and love you for all the things that you have done for
   them in all the years past!!</p> <p>&ldquo;Life&rdquo; is a GIFT to
   you. The way you live your life is your gift to those who come after.
   Make it a fantastic one.</p> <p>Remember: &ldquo;It is Health that is
   real Wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.&rdquo;</p> <p>~Your kids
   are becoming you&hellip;&hellip;but your grandchildren are perfect!<br>
   ~Going out is good.. coming home is even better!<br> ~You forget
   names&hellip; but it&rsquo;s OK, because other people forgot they even
   knew you!!!<br> ~You realize you&rsquo;re never going to be really good
   at anything&hellip;. especially golf.<br> ~The things you used to care
   to do, you no longer care to do, but you really do care that you
   don&rsquo;t care to do them anymore.</p> <p>~You sleep better on a
   lounge chair with the TV blaring than in bed. It&rsquo;s called
   &ldquo;pre-sleep.&rdquo;<br> ~You miss the days when everything worked
   with just an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; switch..<br> ~You
   tend to use more 4 letter words &hellip;
   &ldquo;what?&rdquo;&hellip;&rdquo;when?&rdquo;&hellip;???<br> ~Now that
   you can afford expensive jewelry, it&rsquo;s not safe to wear it
   anywhere.<br> ~You notice everything they sell in stores is
   &ldquo;sleeveless?!&rdquo;<br> ~What used to be freckles are now liver
   spots.<br> ~Everybody whispers.<br> ~You have 3 sizes of clothes in
   your closet&hellip;. 2 of which you will never wear.</p> <p>~But
   &ldquo;Old&rdquo; is good in some things:<br> Old Songs, Old movies
   &hellip;<br> and best of all, our dear &hellip;OLD FRIENDS!!</p> <p

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;">I have lived in Las Vegas
   for over 10 years. It is a must visit city. There are many exciting
   places to see in Vegas.<br><em>I am not affiliated with any of the
   links I am giving you, just suggestions.</em></p> <p>My best advice is
   to visit Las Vegas in the spring or fall. The summers (July and August)
   are dreadfully hot. The Winter ( December and January) are usually
   cold, but has some nice days. The&nbsp;<b>best time</b> to visit Las
   Vegas is from March to May and from September to November. <strong>You
   don&rsquo;t have to gamble to have fun.&nbsp;</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Shows:</strong> Las Vegas has many great show with varying
   range of prices. <strong>Check out <a
   href="https://m.vegas.com/traveltips/top-10-las-vegas-shows/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10
   shows.</a></strong></p> <p>There are <strong>bus rides</strong> that
   are inexpensive. You can ride from one end of the strip to the other,
   and even ride to downtown Vegas. I like to take a ride at night and see
   the beautiful town lit up.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay:</strong></p>
   <p><strong>The strips hotels</strong> <strong>are expensive</strong>.
   Watch out for added on &ldquo;resort fee&rdquo; that they don&rsquo;t
   mention until you get ready to pay. Always ask for the &ldquo;complete
   price&rdquo;. You usually can get a better price by calling the hotel
   directly.&nbsp; If you do stay on the strip, try to get one in the
   middle as there is a LOT of walking to see it end to end. Even if you
   stay on the strip you might want to visit other hotels away from the
   strip to eat your meals.<strong> Food is VERY expensive on the
   strip.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Most Hotels on the <strong>strip</strong>
   also charge a<strong> car parking fee</strong>. Up to $30 a day. A very
   few offer free parking. Check this link for up to date information for
   Hotel parking: <strong><a
   href="https://www.lasvegasdirect.com/las-vegas-parking-fees/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Las Vegas Hotel Parking
   Fees</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Circus Circus Hotel &amp;
   Resort.</strong> A family favorite Las Vegas resort since its
   inception, the Circus Circus Resort and Casino is full of family-fun
   activities. From the thrills of the Adventuredome to the<strong> live
   circus acts right on the casino floor</strong>! This affordable hotel
   is on the north end of the strip and is one of the best choices for a
   family vacation to Las Vegas.&nbsp; They also have a <strong>travel
   trailer parking</strong>.&nbsp; Even if you don&rsquo;t stay there, it
   is a great place for you and the kids to visit.</p> <div

   Downtown Las Vegas.</p></div> <p>Located on the very north end of the
   strip is The Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, where the popular reality
   show&nbsp;<strong><em>Pawn Stars</em></strong> is filmed, has become a
   tourist destination now more popular than the wedding chapels with
   which it shares its bit of Las Vegas Boulevard. I visited when the
   stars of the show were still on site. Kinda cheesy now, long lines,
   none of the stars are usually there. But you can get a T-shirt and say
   you were there. Lords knows I&rsquo;ve wasted more time and money in
   worse ways.</p> <p>The <strong><a

   tractions/flamingo-wildlife-habitat/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow
   noopener noreferrer">Flamingo Wildlife Habitat</a></strong>, is a great
   place to take a short serenity break from the hustle and bustle of the
   Strip. It is home to (naturally) flamingos, but you&rsquo;ll also find
   swans, ducks, koi, turtles and even two rescued pelicans. Lush
   landscaping makes for great pictures: think waterfalls, palms trees,
   and plenty of places to sit. The habitat is family-friendly, and
   it&rsquo;s free.</p> <p>At the <strong>Bellagio</strong>, for instance,
   you can visit the&nbsp;<a

   <strong>mountains</strong> where you can camp, hike and enjoy the
   scenery. Even snow ski in the winter. Hiking may not be the first thing
   that pops to mind when you think of Las Vegas, but within an hour of
   the city, you can find some unexpected and extraordinary landscapes,
   with outstanding hiking trails. Make a day of it.</p> <p>Two or three
   times a day, the <strong>Mirage&rsquo;s volcano</strong> rumbles into
   life, spewing flames and doing a nice, friendly impersonation of a real
   volcano. Crowds gather early to get a glimpse of this iconic curb-side
   attraction&ndash;when it first appeared on the Strip, it was the first
   Vegas exterior entertainment of its kind. The entire lagoon area in
   front of the Mirage comes to life when the volcano is erupting.

   600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>As an RN I worked for Hospice
   for 5 years. Those were some of the most rewarding years of my 40 year
   career.</strong></em></p> <p>Enrolling in hospice care
   <strong>early</strong> helps loved ones live better and live longer.
   Hospice care decreases the burden on family, decreases the
   family&rsquo;s likelihood of having a complicated grief and prepares
   family members for their loved one&rsquo;s death.
   <b>Hospice</b>&nbsp;care is designed
   to<strong>&nbsp;provide</strong>&nbsp;pain management, symptom control,
   psychosocial support, and spiritual care to patients and their families
   when the illness cannot be cured.</p> <p>No one wants to think about
   losing someone they love. For that reason, <strong>many families
   delay</strong> discussions about end-of-life care. If you are asking
   yourself when to call hospice, there is a good chance your loved one
   may already be eligible to receive this added layer of uniquely
   specialized care and support. Even if your loved one is not currently
   eligible for hospice care, gathering information about when you should
   call hospice before a crisis hits will give you time to understand the
   different options available and determine the best fit for your
   family.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hospice is a
   Blessing not a Burden</strong></p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Hospice is
   <strong>free</strong> for the terminally ill. Hospice gets paid
   <strong>100%</strong> through your insurance, medicaid, or medicare
   benefits. Most agencies will take the terminally ill even if they have
   no means to pay. Hospice does not pay for a place to stay except for a
   short period of time for <strong>pain management</strong>.&nbsp;
   Hospice also allows a patient to be cared for in a facility for a
   period of time, not because the patient needs it, but because the
   family caregiver needs a break. This is known as respite care.</p>
   <p><strong>Who qualifies:&nbsp;</strong> Two physicians, the attending
   physician and the&nbsp;<b>hospice</b> medical director, must certify
   the patient is terminally ill, with a six-month or less life expectancy
   <strong>if the disease takes its normal course</strong>.
   But&nbsp;hospice care can be provided for as long as the person&rsquo;s
   doctor and&nbsp;<b>hospice care</b> team certify that the condition
   remains life-limiting. I have had patients on Hospice for several
   years. A person needs to be <strong>home bound</strong>, meaning a
   <strong>taxing</strong> effort to get out of their home.
   <strong>Hospice</strong><b>&nbsp;care</b> is for people of any age and
   at any stage in an illness, whether that illness is curable, chronic,
   or life-threatening. I have had very young and very old patients. If
   you or a loved one are suffering from symptoms of a disease or
   disorder, be sure to ask your current physician if he/she thinks you or
   your loved one may qualify.&nbsp; <b>Hospice does not cover 24 hour
   care but they are always available for an emergency.&nbsp;</b></p>
   <p><strong>Symptoms your loved one may need Hospice:</strong> Frequent
   visits to the ER or hospital admissions. A decline in their ability to
   perform daily tasks including eating, getting dressed, walking, or
   using the bathroom. An increase in falls. Changes to their mental
   abilities.&nbsp; Progressive weight lose. Skin tears, infections, and
   other signs of deteriorating health.</p> <p><strong>Pain
   management:</strong> Hospice covers <strong>ALL</strong> medication.
   They work very hard with a doctor to manage pain.</p> <p><strong>The
   Hospice staff includes:</strong></p> <p><strong>Doctors</strong>
   &ndash; who oversees medications and oversees the nurses and to assure
   the best care possible.</p> <p><strong>Nurses</strong> -Who usually
   visit once a week or more often if needed.</p> <p><strong>Home Health
   Aids</strong>&ndash; Who usually visit 3 times a week for personal
   care.</p> <p><strong>Counselors</strong>&ndash; Who usually visit one a
   month.</p> <p><strong>Pharmacist</strong>&ndash; Where medication can
   be received 24 hours a day if needed.</p> <p><strong>Social
   Workers</strong>&ndash; Who assist with any problems and comfort
   measures.</p> <p><strong>Bereavement Counselors</strong> &ndash; To
   help with the end of life decision. Yes, Hospice helps even after your
   loved one has passed away.</p> <p><strong>Volunteers</strong> &ndash;
   Who will sit with a patient, while you get a break. Sometimes even
   while you take a short vacation.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Hospice staff is available 24 hours a
   day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Does my loved one have to stay
   on Hospice?</strong> No, they are free to op-out at any time. For
   instance, if they fall and break a leg, they can still go to the
   emergency room then may go to a rehab center. Their previous insurance
   will take back over. They can re-enroll when they return home.&nbsp;
   <strong>Please notify Hospice&nbsp; immediately.&nbsp;</strong></p>
   <p>As you can see I am a strong supporter. The end of life does not
   have to be a burden or painful.</p> <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wait to call
   Hospice the very last days of a loved ones life</strong>. They offer
   support throughout the terminal illness.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p

   Oil</strong> from the Dollar Tree store.&nbsp; <strong>Coconut oil,
   cocoa butter, shea butter</strong>. Natural is best, there&rsquo;s so
   much chemicals and everything that we eat drink smell listen to. Why
   buy another product with things in it you don&rsquo;t know. Anything
   with coconut oil in it. I use Oil of Olay ultra moisture with Shea
   butter body lotion.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s might be your <strong>vitamin
   D</strong> levels are getting low. My skin felt like snakeskin so rough
   &amp; no cream or lotion will help, but getting my vitamin D upped
   does. Now it&rsquo;s normal&amp; soft. Activated vitamin D analogs have
   been shown to increase expression of a protein called filaggrin in the
   skin. Filaggrin is intimately involved with keeping the skin moist and
   those without the gene for filaggrin often have very severe eczema. I
   added liquid vitamin D to Penetrix &ndash; which is absorbed into the
   skin. Penetrix, which is commercially available, is sort of a modern
   day DMSO. Penetrix appeared to bring the vitamin D into the body. No
   data, but seems promising. Had added <strong>about 50,000 IU of vitamin
   D to a 1 ounce of penetrix</strong> &ndash; which was used up in about
   2 weeks. Did it for my wife. It seemed to help my psoriasis as well. We
   have been using it for years without vitamin D. Amazon has it &ndash;
   and there are &gt;900 positive comments on the stuff.</p> <p><img

   <div></div> <div>A pharmacist friend told me that Vaseline was the best
   for that. I bought <strong>Vaseline Intensive Care</strong> for
   severely dry skin. It increases your skin&rsquo;s moisture by 250% and
   has Vitamin E in it. It works wonders. If I don&rsquo;t keep my skin
   moisturized, I get eczema. It&rsquo;s accepted by the National Eczema
   Association. I use it all the time now. I&rsquo;m fair and older so I
   had real success. It&rsquo;s not heavy or greasy. I buy the jar of
   cream.</div> <div><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail

   sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Fill a
   zip lock bag with water and 5 or 6 shiny pennies and hang it in the
   problem area. In my case it was a particular window in my home. It had
   a slight passage way for insects. Every since I have done that, it has
   kept flies and wasps away. Some say that wasps and flies mistake the
   bag for some other insect nest and are threatened.</p> <p>Regarding the
   science behind zip log bags of water? Research found that the millions
   of molecules of water presents its own prism effect and given that
   flies have a lot of eyes, to them it&rsquo;s like a zillion disco balls
   reflecting light, colors and movement in a dizzying manner. When you
   figure that flies are prey for many other bugs, animals, birds, etc.,
   they simply won&rsquo;t take the risk of being around that much
   perceived action. I moved to a rural area and thought these
   &ldquo;hillbillies&rdquo; were just yanking my city boy chain but I
   tried it and it worked immediately! We went from hundreds of flies to
   seeing the occasional one, but he didn&rsquo;t hang around long.</p>

   dried food:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong> OVEN IS OFF!</strong> Put
   the dry goods in your jars leave the head space 1/<span
   class="text_exposed_show">4 &ldquo;.&nbsp; Make sure you wipe the rips
   of your jars and the lids are clean.</span></p> <p><span
   class="text_exposed_show">Place the lids and rings on finger and
   tighten them . </span></p> <p><span class="text_exposed_show">Place
   them on a cookie sheet inside the cold oven. Then after you have all
   your jars in the oven (on cookie sheet) shut the door turn oven on 250
   degrees F.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span
   class="text_exposed_show">After the oven heats to the temp then set the
   timer for 45 minutes. After the timer goes off just turn oven off, DO
   <strong>NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR</strong>! Let the jars cool off it the
   oven.</span></p> <p><span class="text_exposed_show">After the jars are
   cool pull them out and make sure each jar is sealed. If it is not seal
   remove lid and ring clean them again and repeat the process.
   </span></p> <p><span class="text_exposed_show">You can dry can many
   jars at the same time and they will last many years and still taste
   fresh.</span></p> <p>This can work for oats, oat meal, flour, cake
   mixes, pancake mixes. But&nbsp; freeze for a week before canning to
   kill any bugs.</p> <p>Watch video for more instructions:<br><iframe
   src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/304NgJg8AfA" width="450"
   height="450" frameborder="0"
   allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p><em>Food such as
   green beans,etc. still need to be pressured cooked.&nbsp;</em></p>
   <p><strong>For potato chips</strong>. You would need an <strong>oxygen
   absorbers</strong> because of the oils in the chips. You can buy them
   off Amazon they are these little packets that you would drop in the jar
   after you put the product you want to preserve, then place the lid and
   the ring on the jar finger tight the packet will suck all the oxygen
   out of the jar, thus leaving the jar vacuumed packed. This DOES NOT go
   in the oven. To use oxygen absorbers. Open the jar a drop a packet
   inside the jar and make sure the rim of the jar is clean then put the
   lid and ring on the jar.. The oxygen absorber will suck the oxygen out
   of the jar. You want to keep it in a room temp. if it gets to hot the
   condensation can build up, and ruin your canned good. Being too cold
   can cause condensation when the product warms up after being to
   cold.</p> <div id="attachment_64367" style="width: 160px"

   id="caption-attachment-64367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Oxygen
   Absorbers</strong></p></div> <p>With oatmeal , flour or anything with
   flour or grains you need to freeze for a week then either dry can or
   use a oxygen absorbers. If you want a long term on spices it is
   recommend that you use oxygen absorbers. They will make them last for a
   very long time.</p> <p><strong>How To Dry fruit in the
   oven:</strong></p> <p>Start by choosing a fruit to dehydrate. Wash the
   fruit well and remove the stalks, leaves, or other inedible parts. You
   can leave on the peel if you want, but if you&rsquo;re going to do that
   then it&rsquo;s better to buy organic fruit. Some fruits, such as
   apples and peaches, will dry better if the peel is removed.</p> <p>Cut
   the fruit into small pieces so it will dry faster. In order to make the
   fruit look appealing and minimize discoloration, soak them in lemon
   juice and water for 10 minutes. Then drain and dry them with a
   lint-free towel.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to minimum temperature (about
   50 degrees). Use a lower temperature for thin fruits like sliced
   apples, bananas and peaches. Strawberries require a higher temperature.
   Over time, you will learn how long each fruit takes. If your oven does
   not go down to 50 degrees you can also leave the oven on for about 5
   minutes then turn it off for 10 minutes turn it back on for 5 minutes
   off for 10 sometimes it takes a little longer to do it but you still
   get the same result without worrying about burning.</p> <p>Line the
   baking sheet with wax paper and arrange the fruits in a single layer,
   without letting them touch. In order to prevent the fruit from curling
   during drying, cover them with a pizza pan with holes poked in it.</p>
   <p>Place them in the oven and leave the door slightly ajar, in order to
   prevent them from burning. This process normally takes around an hour
   and a half. When the fruit is dry, remove it from the oven and allow it
   to cool before eating.</p> <p>Watch video for more

   600px"></p> <p><strong>Go to bed and get up at the same time each
   day</strong>, even on the weekends. This will create a habit that helps
   you sleep.</p> <p><strong>Limit nap time during the day</strong>. Nap
   only for 15 minutes or less. If you get drowsy during the day, get up
   and move around.</p> <p><strong>Sleep in clothes</strong> that are
   comfortable for YOU.</p> <p><strong>Do not watch TV</strong> during you
   sleeping time. The TV will end up disrupting your sleep.</p> <p>Make
   sure your <strong>bedroom is dark</strong>. Try a sleep mask or heavy
   curtains.</p> <p>Do not use <strong>caffeine</strong> at least 4 hours
   before bedtime. Caffeine is a stimulate and will make it harder to get
   to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Cut down on all liquids 2 hours</strong>
   before bedtime. The urge to urinate will make you wake up.</p>
   <p><strong>Stressed?</strong> Try these <a
   href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/relaxation-techniques-f
   or-stress-relief.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener
   noreferrer">Relaxing Techniques&nbsp;</a></p> <p><strong>Keep your
   bedroom cool</strong>. People sleep better in a cool environment.</p>
   <p><strong>Think pleasant thoughts</strong>. Like birds singing,</p>
   <p>Put <strong>lavender</strong> around your bed. Lavender is very
   soothing. It could be a plant or lavender oil.</p> <p><strong>If wake
   up at night</strong> for more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do a
   quiet, non-stimulating activity, such as reading a book. Keep the
   lights dim and avoid screens so as not to cue your body that it&rsquo;s
   time to wake up.</p> <p><strong>Try this just before you try to go to
   sleep</strong>: breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold
   your breath for seven seconds, and exhale through your mouth for eight
   seconds.</p> <p>Take a <strong>warm bath or shower</strong> just before
   bedtime.</p> <p>Try a <strong>Melatonin</strong> Supplement. Or other
   over the counter sleeping pills such as:</p> <ul class="i8Z77e"><li
   class="TrT0Xe">Diphenhydramine (found in brand names like Nytol,
   Sominex, Sleepinal, Compoz)</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">Doxylamine (brand
   names such as Unisom, Nighttime Sleep Aid)</li> </ul><p>For at least 1
   hour before bedtime: <strong>Put aside your work</strong>. Turn off the
   computer. Stay off the phone and away from social media like Facebook
   or Twitter. There will always be more to do, but you have done enough
   for today. Now it&rsquo;s time to relax and prepare for sleep. Fill the
   time with relaxing activities like reading or watching a boring
   movie.</p> <p><strong>Foods</strong> that might help you sleep better
   at night:</p> <ol class="X5LH0c"><li class="TrT0Xe">Almonds.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">Turkey</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">Chamomile Tea</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">Kiwi</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">Tart Cherry Juice</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">Fatty Fish</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">Walnuts</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">Passionflower Tea</li> <li>White rice</li>
   <li>Pistachios- one of the most melatonin rich food.</li>
   </ol><p><strong>If you continue to struggle</strong>, speak with your
   doctor about additional treatment options.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p

   Club</h2> <p>Since 1990, it&rsquo;s been our wine club&rsquo;s mission
   to help <strong>artisan wineries</strong>&nbsp;share their small-batch
   wines with wine enthusiasts everywhere. At The California Wine Club we
   happen to think these wines&nbsp;<strong>simply taste
   better</strong>&nbsp;than the mass-produced wines that dominate store
   shelves.</p> <p>We visit the wineries, meet the families and winemakers
   behind the wines and then invite them to share their favorite wines
   with our wine club members.&nbsp; Every wine featured in our five
   monthly wine clubs comes from a&nbsp;real-working winery and is proudly
   backed by our wine club&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Love
   It</em>&nbsp;Guarantee.</p>
   <p>If&nbsp;<strong>quality</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;service
   matter&nbsp;</strong>to you, and you&rsquo;ve been searching for a wine
   of the month club to try out, we&nbsp;invite you to give us&nbsp;a try
   and get to know the artisan wineries we feature.</p> <p>We also
   have<strong>&nbsp;gift&nbsp;</strong>options for all of
   our&nbsp;<strong>wine club&nbsp;</strong>levels. Whether you&rsquo;re
   looking for&nbsp;<strong>wine gifts&nbsp;</strong>for special occasions
   like weddings or for business gifts, we have you covered!</p>

   <ul><li>Kosher salt (to taste)</li> <li>2 russet potatoes (1 1/2 pounds

   chives</li> <li>1 Tbsp. finely chopped thyme</li> <li>1 tsp. freshly

   <li>3/4 cup instant mashed potatoes flakes</li> <li>Canola oil (for

   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"> <ol><li>Bring a large pot of
   generously salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until just
   slightly tender, 6 to 7 minutes; drain and set aside to let cool
   briefly. While still warm, grate potatoes on the large holes of a box
   grater and transfer to a large bowl. Using your hands, mix in chives,
   thyme, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, nutmeg, and pepper.</li> <li>Form mixture into
   24 balls, using about 1 1/2 Tbsp. of the potato mixture for each. Press
   them together firmly so they hold their shape. (Clean your hands from
   time to time to make the shaping easier.) Place potato flakes in a
   medium bowl, then roll potato balls through flakes to coat, shaking off
   any excess; transfer to a sheet tray.</li> <li>Pour oil into a large,
   deep skillet to a depth of 1/2 inch, then heat over medium-high heat;
   oil is ready when a potato ball sizzles vigorously when dropped in.
   Working in two or three batches, fry potato balls, turning
   occasionally, until deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted
   spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined sheet tray to let drain.</li>
   <li>Fry bacon to desired crispness. Stick toothpicks or skewers through
   tater tots and top with slices of fried bacon.</li> </ol></div> <div
   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-notes"> <p>TO FREEZE: Transfer cooled tater
   tots to an airtight container. Freeze up to 1 month. To bake, preheat
   oven to 400 degrees F and bake until heated through, about 15-17
   minutes.</p> </div> </div> <p><!--End WPRM Recipe--></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

   <ol><li>Melt butter over medium heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Let it cook
   and watch it closely until 3 to 5 min until the butter begins to foam,
   forms a golden brown color and browned bits form on the bottom.
   Immediately remove it from the heat. Allow to cool for about 10 min,
   then place butter in a small bowl, and freeze until solid, about 2
   hours.</li> <li>In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, and
   brown sugar and stir together with a fork. Tap the small bowl of butter
   on the counter to shake it out (it should be in one large blocUse the
   large holes on a box grater to grate the butter directly into the dry
   ingredients. Stir with a fork.</li> <li>Make a well in the center of
   the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk with the vanilla. Use a
   large fork and a large rubber spatula to stir the mixture together. If
   it seems a little dry you may add more buttermilk until it forms a
   shaggy dough.</li> <li>Sprinkle a pastry mat, wooden cutting board or a
   clean smooth counter top with flour. Turn the dough out onto the
   surface and pat a few times with your hands until it loosely holds
   together. (Don&rsquo;t knead it too much or the warmth in your palms
   will melt the butter and cause the biscuits to be tough.)</li> <li>Use
   a large sharp knife to divide the dough in half. Roughly shape each
   half into a square. Stack one of the halves on top of the other and use
   a rolling pin to roll it together into one mass. Repeat this process
   two to three more times before patting it into one final rectangle.
   (This way the biscuits will bake flaky).</li> <li>Wrap the dough in
   plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to
   overnight.</li> <li>Preheat oven to 425*. Line a baking sheet with
   parchment paper. Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom rack of the
   oven.</li> <li>Sprinkle your work surface with flour and unwrap the
   biscuit dough out onto it. Use a bench scraper or very sharp knife to
   trim the edges of the rectangle. Use a square cookie cutter, or a knife
   to cut the remaining dough into squares, about 2&Prime; each.</li>
   <li>Remove the cut biscuits to the baking sheet you&rsquo;ve lined with
   parchment paper, placing them rather close to each other (it will help
   them rise higher). Freeze until cold, about 15 min.</li> <li>Bake until

   water</li> </ul><h4>Whipped Cream Center:</h4> <ul><li>4 ounces cream

   &frac12; teaspoon vanilla</li> <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

   together flour and salt. Cut in shortening with pastry blender or
   blending fork until pieces are the size of small peas.</li> <li>To make
   pastry extra tender and flaky, divide shortening in half. Cut in first
   half until mixture looks like corn meal. Then cut in remaining half
   until looks like small peas.</li> <li>Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon of the
   water over part of the flour mixture. Gently toss with a fork; push to
   one side of bowl.</li> <li>Sprinkle next Tablespoon water over dry
   part; mix lightly; push to moistened part at side. Repeat until all is
   moistened. Gather up with fingers; form into ball.</li> <li>On a
   lightly floured surface; flatten ball sightly and roll 1/8 inch thick.
   If edges split, pinch together. Always roll dough from center to edge.
   Using light strokes.</li> <li> <p>To transfer pastry, roll it over
   rolling pin; unroll pastry over pie plate, fitting loosely onto bottom
   and sides into 8 inch square pan.</p> </li> <li>Prick bottom and sides
   well with a fork. Bake in very hot oven (450 degrees F.) 10 to 12
   minutes. Set aside to cool.</li> </ol><h4>Whipped Cream:</h4>
   <ol><li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese,
   powdered sugar and vanilla until light and creamy. Remove cream cheese
   mixture from mixing bowl and set aside.</li> <li>Add 1 cup heavy
   whipping cream to mixing bowl and whip until soft peaks form.</li>
   <li>Add cream cheese mixture to heavy cream and beat just until stiff
   peaks form.</li> <li>Keep refrigerated until ready to use.</li>
   <li>Spread over cooled crust.</li> </ol><h4>Strawberries:</h4> <ol><li>
   <p>Wash strawberries and remove stems; cut large berries in half,
   smaller strawberries can be left whole.</p> </li> <li>Combine
   strawberries, sugar, and vanilla in a saucepan.</li> <li>Cook over
   medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. The mixture will sizzle for a
   while, but then juice will begin to form.</li> <li>Continue stirring;
   mash a few strawberries with a wooden spoon or heat-proof spatula to
   help produce the syrup.</li> <li>Cook until sauce thickens, about 15
   minutes.</li> <li> <p>Cool and spread on top of the crust and whipped

   <p><strong>Throw out stuff</strong> you no longer need before you move.
   <strong>Clean everything</strong> before packing it.</p>
   <p><strong>Mark your boxes</strong> for each room, and sit down and
   make your first things first list of priority in bills and calculate it
   up. Pack a box or two with clothes and items you&rsquo;ll need right
   away for work, showers etc.</p> <p><strong>Pack a big overnight
   bag</strong> with all the most important things you need to survive the
   first few days</p> <p><span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x">Put
   <strong>cleaning supplies</strong> in a labeled box and load it last to
   make sure it is one of the first boxes you unload. Put plenty of paper
   towels and toilet paper in it.</span></span></p> <p>Mark each box list
   what is in the box and tape the list to it. Day 1 only unpack what is
   needed . you know you are not going to cook that day so just unpack
   bathroom and bedroom. Day 2 unpack the kitchen don&rsquo;t rush it as
   you will end up reorganizing.</p> <p><strong>Label your moving boxes by
   room</strong>. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen etc. You can use color coded
   labels so it is a quick at a glance process. Collect boxes and packing
   materials early. Pack non-essentials early to get that out of the
   way.</p> <p><strong>When moving the bed</strong> put the screws in a
   ziplock and take the bag with you in the car so you don&rsquo;t have to
   look for them at the new place. Same goes for any shelf support
   hardware.</p> <p>Make a <strong>fanny pack</strong> of tape, sharpies,
   box cutters while you are packing.</p> <p>Buy or rent a
   <strong>dolly</strong>. Makes loading and unloading much easier.</p>
   <p>Don&rsquo;t forget <strong>toilet paper</strong>. Don&rsquo;t pack
   it all. Put a roll or 2 in your purse! Sure will come in handy.</p>
   <p><strong>Pack the truck thinking ahead</strong> put the last room you
   have most likely the living room in first so it will be the last 1 you
   unload and put the furthest room probably bedroom in last so it&rsquo;s
   the first of the truck and won&rsquo;t be nothing in your way
   moving.</p> <p>If you have a lot of <strong>books</strong> move them in
   suitcases not totes they are heavy and suitcases tend to have
   wheels.</p> <p>Put <strong>Styrofoam plates</strong> between real ones
   to protect them.</p> <p>Dollar Store is great to get <strong>simple
   essentials</strong> like your utensil organizers, ice cube trays.
   (Don&rsquo;t get the pot holders they sucks unless they&rsquo;re all
   cloth)</p> <p>Make a <strong>special box</strong>. Use for immediate
   things you will need. Birth certificates, change of address forms,
   pens, pencils, scissors, safety pins, tape, needle, thread, extra
   toothbrushes, toothpaste, immunizations forms for kids &amp; pets,
   things like this that you will need immediately.</p> <p><strong>Egg
   cartons</strong> from grocery store work great for packing smaller
   items, like jewelry, etc.</p> <p>Use a <strong>trash bags</strong> as
   well a <strong>note pad</strong> to keep on the fridge or near the door
   on a hook. You will find this tip very handy.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Exit plan and plan before moving with a friend or
   S/O:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>If you are moving in with anyone you are not
   married to, be sure to <strong>make a list</strong> of what is yours
   and what is their&rsquo;s. Will make a huge difference if one or the
   other moves out. <strong>The courts will not enforce</strong> it you
   both do not have a signed list. Have an exit plan in writing, signed by
   both of you, such as who will pay the rent if one moves.</p> <p>1.
   <strong>Put into writing</strong> what each of you is responsible for
   paying, what chores each of you are responsible for doing, date it and
   <strong>BOTH OF YOU sign it</strong>. 2. As to photographs, MAKE
   CERTAIN that before you take the photos that you have a paper in the
   shot on which you have written the date &ndash; that way, all of the
   photos will clearly display when the photos were taken &ndash; if need
   in the future, this will be your BEST proof as to how the room, or
   whatever it is you are photographing, looked like at the time you moved
   in.</p> <p>Make sure the<strong> both of you are on the lease</strong>.
   If anyone leaves. You both are responsible for the lease.</p>

   600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have use just <strong>vinegar</strong>
   but with the smell you might need a candle but the shower walls are
   clean.</p> <p><strong>Rubbing alcohol</strong> works great !!</p>
   <p><strong>Dawn dish soap with white vinega</strong>r and warm water,
   in a spray bottle then rinse well. Best cleaner I&rsquo;ve ever tried.
   &nbsp;1 cup white vinegar heated in microwave 1 minute. Add 1 cup blue
   dawn, shake together in spray bottle. Works wonders!</p> <p>Mix
   <strong>Windex with lime juice and WD40</strong>. Spray on and
   rinse.</p> <p>Use a <strong>Magic Eraser</strong>. It was a miracle
   like oven cleaner but without the chemicals.</p> <p><strong>Toilet bowl
   cleaner</strong> from the dollar tree. Trust me, I used it when I
   worked CLEANING houses or Blue Lysol toilet bowl cleaner takes all the
   hard water stains off. Works awesome!!!</p> <p><strong>Bounce dryer
   sheets</strong>. They take the soap scum right off.</p> <p>Scrub with
   <strong>Soft</strong> <strong>Scrub</strong> and rinse.</p>
   <p><strong>Scrubbing Bubbles</strong> is an awesome cleaner. Just spray
   and wipe. Makes everything shine!</p> <p><strong>Clorox Wipes</strong>
   for the doors. Easy to use.</p> <p>If it is textured glass <strong>baby
   oil</strong> works wonders.</p> <p>If you have <strong>mold</strong>
   use <strong>bleach</strong> mixed with water: 1 cap to 1 gallon
   water.</p> <p>Once you get them sparkling, I would recommend getting a
   high quality<strong> rubber window squeegee</strong> and using it after
   every shower. &nbsp;Put car wax on and wipe off after cleaning. Mine
   has cut down the need to clean the doors to only occasionally. Everyone
   who takes a shower should wipe it down afterwards.</p> <p>Some shower
   doors have <strong>manufacture recommendations</strong> depending on if
   they are glazed or other specs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align:

   sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p> <p>Cats mark their
   territory by &ldquo;spraying&rdquo; the area and it smells bad. Most of
   us love furry animals but they can be a pest.</p> <p><strong>DO NOT
   FEED STRAY CATS!</strong> It makes the problem worse. <strong>Keep them
   away from your children</strong>. They can be dangerous and have
   diseases.&nbsp; Feral cats will find their own food in the wild.</p>
   <p><b>Try these tips to keep them away the Humane way:&nbsp;</b></p>
   <p><strong>Bounce dryer sheets</strong>: Place them around where the
   cats sprayed. They don&rsquo;t like the smell and will stay away.</p>
   <p>Tip my cat breeder told me. It&rsquo;s totally weird but she swears
   by it: have a man in your family go out in the middle of the night and
   <strong>pee</strong> all around the perimeter of your proper (or area
   of concern) and they will stay away.&nbsp; She swears it&rsquo;s works
   for her and my sister had her husband do it and they say it worked!</p>
   <p>Spray <strong>vinegar</strong>. Gets rid off smell and odors so the
   cats can&rsquo;t retrace their steps.</p> <p>Place <strong>moth balls
   </strong>around the area.</p> <p>Try a <strong>Cat Scram</strong>. It
   it motion activated, and it puts out a sound they hate, but is hardly
   audible to humans! You can buy them on Amazon but cost between $35 to
   $50.</p> <p><strong>Cinnamon</strong>, <strong>Cayenne pepper</strong>
   or <strong>Chili powder</strong> sprinkled around.</p> <p>A fake
   <strong>rattlesnake statue</strong> that is motion activated to shake
   and it rattles.</p> <p>Use Motion activated <strong>water
   sprinkler</strong>.</p> <p>If you use <strong>traps from rescue
   shelter</strong>, they will come get them if trapped. Look into a place
   that will do a trap and release basically neutering a cat and it will
   actually stop spraying. Look into cat rescues not a shelter.</p>

   600px"></p> <p>It is found that a mix of honey and cinnamon helps most
   diseases. Honey is produced in most of the countries of the world.
   Scientists of today also note honey as very effective medicine for all
   kinds of diseases. Honey can be used without side effects which is also
   a plus.Today&rsquo;s science says that even though honey is sweet, when
   it is taken in the right dosage as a medicine, it does not harm even
   diabetic patients.</p> <p>Honey keeps forever. Does not ever go
   bad.</p> <p><strong> FOR HEART DISEASES:</strong> Make a paste of honey
   and cinnamon powder, put it on toast instead of jelly and jam and eat
   it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol and could
   potentially save one from heart attack.</p> <p><strong>FOR
   ARTHRITIS:</strong> Arthritis patients can benefit by taking one cup of
   hot water with two tablespoons of honey and one small teaspoon of
   cinnamon powder. When taken daily even chronic arthritis can be
   helped.</p> <p><strong>BLADDER INFECTIONS:</strong> Take two
   tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of
   lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the germs in the bladder.</p>
   <p><strong>CHOLESTEROL:</strong> Two tablespoons of honey and three
   teaspoons of Cinnamon Powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water given to a
   cholesterol patient was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the
   blood by 10 percent within two hours.</p> <p><strong>COLDS:</strong>
   Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon
   lukewarm honey with 1/4 spoon cinnamon powder daily for three days.
   This process will help most chronic cough, cold, and, clear the
   sinuses, and it&rsquo;s delicious too!</p> <p><strong>UPSET
   STOMACH:</strong> Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache
   and also is said to clear stomach ulcers from its root.</p>
   <p><strong>GAS:</strong> According to the studies done in India and
   Japan, it is revealed that when Honey is taken with cinnamon powder the
   stomach is relieved of gas.</p> <p><strong>IMMUNE SYSTEM:</strong>
   Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system
   and protects the body from bacterial and viral attacks. Scientists have
   found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts.
   Constant use of Honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles (where DNA
   is contained) to fight bacterial and viral diseases.</p>
   <p><strong>INDIGESTION:</strong> Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two
   tablespoons of honey taken before food is eaten relieves acidity and
   digests the heaviest of meals.</p> <p><strong>INFLUENZA:</strong> A
   scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural
   &lsquo;Ingredient&rsquo; which kills the influenza germs and saves the
   patient from flu.</p> <p><strong>PIMPLES:</strong> Three tablespoons of
   honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste. Apply this paste on
   the pimples before sleeping and wash it off the next morning with warm
   water. When done daily for two weeks, it removes all pimples from the
   root.</p> <p><strong>WEIGHT LOSS: </strong>Daily in the morning one
   half hour before breakfast and on an empty stomach, and at night before
   sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup of water.
   When taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese
   person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to
   accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie
   diet.</p> <p><strong>BAD BREATH:</strong> People of South America,
   gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot
   water first thing in the morning so their breath stays fresh throughout
   the day.</p> <p><strong>Read some studies about Honey and Cinnamon <a

   600px"></p> <p>Marinating a steak is about flavor, not tenderizing.</p>
   <p>Less tender cuts should be marinated for at least 6 hours, but no
   more than 24 hours. Tender cuts of beef, like a tenderloin, only need
   to be marinated for 15 minutes to 1 hour for flavor. Marinating hold
   the juices in the steak.</p> <p>Place the marinade and meat in a sealed
   plastic bag or glass container so that the beef can &ldquo;sit&rdquo;
   in the liquid. Place in refrigerator to marinate anything over 30
   minutes.</p> <p>We recommend making 1/4 to 1/2 cup of marinade for each
   one to two pounds of beef.</p> <p><strong>Marinate
   ingredients:</strong></p> <p>Make a paste of Honey, Dijon mustard and
   garlic pepper.</p> <p>Mix a package of French Onion soup with 2 cups
   water, and 1 cup coffee.</p> <p>Marinate in Root Beer and Apple juice.
   Apple juice and will also tenderize the steak</p> <p>Marinate with
   garlic, olive oil and 1 can cranberry sauce.</p> <p>Apple wood and
   McCormick&rsquo;s sweet and tangy rub. BBQ at low temp.</p>
   <p>Marinading in Orange juice, or beer makes a steak delicious.</p>
   <p>Pineapple juice.</p> <p><span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x">A can of
   cream of onion &amp; golden mushroom mixed together.</span></span></p>
   <p>1 can of coke, 1 can of mushrooms, juice too, 1 can cream of
   mushroom soup, and 1 pkg dry onion soup mix.</p> <p>For a
   <strong>Mexican flare</strong>: marinate in a jar of salsa.</p>
   <p><strong>Awesome dry rubs. </strong></p> <p><strong>No need to
   marinate but let it set 2 hours or more for best results:</strong></p>

   said mustard. It won&rsquo;t taste at all like mustard, it will create

   600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Wear a large shirt</strong> for a
   couple of days, to get your smell on it real good, and then try leaving
   it with them when you go.</p> <p>Try<strong> Melatonin</strong>. 1/4
   human tab. Calming is seen within 15 minutes and our fur kid
   doesn&rsquo;t look or act &lsquo;drugged&rsquo; but handles
   thunderstorms and fireworks while on this. We did some research years
   ago and also talked to our vet. She approved it to see if it would
   work, as Valium was not working for our storm phoetic. Might be worth a
   try to check with your vet to try Melatonin.</p> <p>Some <strong>crate
   training</strong> will help. Put in crate for a little bit and leave
   the room then next time do it for a little longer and so on. Not
   necessarily teaching to be in a crate but working on the separation.
   Crates are a huge help. Sometimes the space without you can be
   frightening and a crate smaller and they kinda make that feel like a
   safe place. Eventually you can just leave the crate door open and
   they&rsquo;ll go there when there having anxiety.</p> <p>Some dogs
   owners have reported success in using&nbsp;<strong>CBD
   oil&nbsp;</strong>to treat dog anxiety. CBD is a compound found in
   cannabis and hemp that dog owners, as well as humans, have found useful
   for treating a variety of different health conditions. If you&rsquo;re
   considering using CBD oil as a treatment for dog anxiety, it&rsquo;s
   best to consult with your <strong>veterinarian.</strong> Your
   veterinarian can help you determine if CBD oil might be a good
   treatment for your dog&rsquo;s anxiety</p> <p><b class="whb">Use a
   Thundershirt. </b><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference" aria-label="Link
   to Reference 6"></sup>These shirts are worn over the dog&rsquo;s torso
   and apply pressure when the dog gets anxious.&nbsp;The dog interprets
   the pressure like a baby interprets swaddling. It is comforting for
   some dogs.</p> <p>Spend five minutes a couple times a day and up the
   amount of time <strong>leaving your dog</strong>. Best to only go into
   the next room or<strong> fake them out</strong> by going out your
   normal door you would leave through. Again this isn&rsquo;t to train
   them to be in a crate it&rsquo;s to condition them to understanding you
   will be back.</p> <p><b class="whb">Use pheromone
   diffusers.</b>&nbsp;Pheromones are chemical messengers given off by a
   dog&rsquo;s mother during nursing to reassure her pups that they are
   safe and secure. Synthetic versions of this chemical, known as&nbsp;Dog
   Appeasing Pheromones (DAPs) are available for purchase as many pet
   superstores. Simply plug them into the wall or attach them to your
   dog&rsquo;s collar and watch them calm your canine companion.</p>
   <p><strong>Play Deep Separation Anxiety Music</strong> to Relax Your
   Dog while you are away or classical music. Such as this:</p> <p><iframe
   src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXtdXcB8BTs" width="450"
   height="450" frameborder="0"
   allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p><strong>Talk to your
   veterinarian</strong>. They will be able to advise you on what measures
   will work best &ndash; either behavioral or medical. If necessary, you
   can get a prescription for stronger medications.</p> <p

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Always wear <strong>sunscreen.</strong></p> <p>Most
   doctors will recommend &ldquo;<strong>Silver
   Cream</strong>&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s formulated to protect against
   and kill bacteria, fungus and yeast. This antimicrobial gel can be
   applied on scrapes, cuts and minor burns. It works for up to three days
   and doesn&rsquo;t sting or stain. This antimicrobial gel also hydrates
   to help minimize scarring.&nbsp; It comes in many different brands and
   can be bought at Walmart and many pharmacies. It can also be bought in
   small packages to take on trips. I once had a very bad scrape on my leg
   and it worked for the pain and helped healed the scrape. For more
   severe burns get a <strong>prescription for a stronger Silverdine
   Cream</strong>. &nbsp;W<span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x">orks
   wonders. Keep in refrigerator for longer life. Great for all wounds or
   burns. Promotes skin healing.</span></span></p> <p><img

   <p><strong>Other remedies</strong> to try:</p> <p><strong>Menthol
   shaving cream.</strong></p> <p>Make a whole pot of <strong>hot black
   tea</strong>. Let it come to room temp. Soak a towel in it&hellip;and
   place on sunburn. Will take the sting right out.</p> <p>Take about a
   <strong>dozen aspirin</strong> and crush them fine (mortar and pestle
   if you have one) then add about a cup and a half of cold buttermilk and
   mix well. Smear all over sunburn. It takes the heat out and won&rsquo;t
   blister.</p> <p><strong>Mouth wash</strong> soaked a paper towel in it
   and lay it on your burn it draws the heat out.</p> <p>Apply
   <strong>Apple cider vinegar</strong> and water mix. Find some paper
   bags cut them in strips dip in apple cider vinegar and lay the strips
   on the burn it will pull the burn out and make it tan.</p>
   <p><strong>Soak in a vinegar bath.</strong></p> <p><strong>Aloe Vera

   alcohol</strong> several times a day. It will take the heat out of your

   <p><span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x">Open <strong>vitamin E
   capsules</strong> and spread on the burn.</span></span></p>
   <p><strong>Lidocaine spray</strong>, nice,&nbsp; just need to spray it
   on, relieves for a long time, can buy it any drug store.</p>
   <p><strong>&nbsp;3 D diaper ointment</strong>. No kidding. It cools it
   off &amp; helps keep the skin moist so it doesn&rsquo;t dry out &amp;
   sting. Works for babies so should work for you too.</p> <p>Sleep under
   <strong>sheets</strong> only.</p> <p>Take a <strong>Benadryl</strong>
   to help out. This&nbsp;medication&nbsp;works by blocking a certain
   natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during
   an&nbsp;allergic reaction.</p> <p><strong>VAGASIL CREAM</strong> will
   stop the pain and itching instantly.</p> <p><strong>If the burn is
   severe</strong> or it blisters see a physician immediately. Can become

   you&rsquo;ll most likely encounter with&nbsp;poison ivy&nbsp;is a stem
   with a larger leaf at the end, and two smaller leaves shooting off the
   sides. The leaves can be notched or smooth on the edges, and they have
   pointed tips. The&nbsp;plant is reddish in the spring, green in summer,
   and yellow/orange in the fall.</p> <p><strong>Signs and symptoms you
   have a poison ivy rash:</strong></p> <p>Skin redness, itching, swelling
   or blisters. You could have difficulty breathing, if you&rsquo;ve
   inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy.</p> <p><strong>How to get
   rid of it:</strong></p> <p>First of all: <strong>DO NOT BURN POISON
   IVY</strong>. It will spread through the air and infect others. This
   happened to my son and it was the worse case of poison ivy he ever
   had.</p> <p>If you find poison ivy and wish to <strong>destroy
   it</strong>,&nbsp; put on gloves and cover the rest of your body with
   clothing that has been secured with duct tape around the edges. Being
   careful to not let the poison ivy touch your shin.</p> <p>Pull the
   plant out 8 inches below the roots.</p> <p><strong>Dissolve 1 cup of
   salt in 1 gallon of water and add in 1 tablespoon of dish
   soap</strong>. Mix well, pour into a water sprayer, and spray away at
   the pulled vines. Spray the ground around where you pulled it
   out.&nbsp; <strong>Careful</strong> this mixture will kill all plants
   near where you spray.</p> <p>Depose in a large plastic bad and place in
   the garbage.</p> <p>Be sure to <strong>take a shower</strong>
   afterwords and wash all clothing you wore in hot water and laundry
   soap.</p> <p><strong>You could rent a goat</strong>. &nbsp;It
   doesn&rsquo;t hurt them, and no use of chemicals.</p> <p>If you break
   out with poison ivy then read this: <a

   600px"></p> <p>Most women will recommend <strong>Black Cohish
   herbs</strong>! You can get it from Dollar General or Walmart.&nbsp; It
   really helped reduce the severity and over time did away with them
   entirely. But be very cautious about taking black cohosh if you are
   taking any other supplements. Some supplements and black cohosh do not
   mix well together.</p> <p>You can try <strong>CBD oil.</strong> Works
   for a lot of women. CBD doesn&rsquo;t just help with the hot flashes
   but also the mood swings.</p> <p><strong>Juiceplus greens</strong> can
   help metabolize estrogen&rsquo;s.</p> <p>The other thing that helps
   with hot flashes, while it will not make them go away it will make them
   more tolerable is, <strong>switch to all cotton undergarments</strong>.
   No more fancy lace and nylon bras. No more fancy lace and nylon
   underwear. Make sure your sheets are cotton, and that your sleepwear is
   cotton. You can return to the nylon and Lace fancy stuff after your hot
   flash periods are over. But for now, comfort is the main thing and
   cotton will help with that.</p> <p><strong>Keep your home as
   cool</strong> as you possible can, have a <strong>fan</strong> going,
   <strong>wear light clothing</strong>, take a shower at night,</p>
   <p>Try a <strong>soy based product</strong> for menopause in the
   holistic section at Walmart. In less than a week you will feel like a
   whole new person. Or <strong>soy milk</strong> it produces estrogen it
   really helps in some people.</p> <p><strong>Stay away from</strong>
   chocolate, sweets, alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, dairy and
   stress.</p> <p>Sit in front of a <strong>fan</strong>.</p> <p>As you
   feel one coming on get <strong>bare feet on floor</strong>, not carpet.
   This will start the blood vessels to construct and this will slow down
   blood flow and give the rest of your body to follow.</p>
   <p><strong>Vitamin E.</strong> Take up to 4 per day. A friend I know
   swear&rsquo;s by them.</p> <p>Some doctors recommend an
   <strong>antidepressant</strong> like Zoloft.</p> <p>I would suggest
   <strong>not to use estrogen.</strong> My sister developed breast cancer
   from using estrogen and we have no family history of breast cancer.

   the bottom of the bowl touch the actual water.</li> <li>Bring the water
   to the boil then turn it down to a simmer. Very slowly melt the cacao
   butter in the bowl of the bain-marie. Take the cacao butter to no
   higher than 40&ndash;45&deg;C/104&ndash;113&deg;If you think it is
   getting too hot but hasn&rsquo;t all melted, take it off the heat to
   finish melting. It is important not to overheat it or the chocolate

   appearance.</li> <li>When the cacao butter has melted and is at around
   40&ndash;45&deg;C/104&ndash;113&deg;F, add the rest of the ingredients.
   This should lower the temperature and we now want to bring it down to
   28&ndash;30&deg;C/82&ndash;86&deg;F; just above or below will be
   fine.</li> <li>Blend all the ingredients together with a hand-held
   blender to get rid of any cacao powder lumps and until velvety smooth
   and glossy. Do not over-blend or the chocolate will stiffen too much.
   If it is too stiff, place the bowl back over the hot water and stir
   gently for a minute or so then remove from the heat.</li> <li>Keep
   stirring the chocolate gently to cool it then, when around
   28&ndash;30&deg;C/82&ndash;86&deg;F, pour it into a silicon mold. Add

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What is a migraine headache:</strong> A
   migraine can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation,
   usually on one side of the head. It&rsquo;s often accompanied by
   nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine
   attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that
   it interferes with your daily activities. Source <a
   href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/
   symptoms-causes/syc-20360201" target="_blank" rel="noopener
   noreferrer">Mayo Clinic&nbsp;</a></p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Home treatments from people who have
   migraines:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Make sure to stay <strong>hydrated
   with water</strong>.</p> <p>Take <strong>Benadryl with Tylenol</strong>
   and sleep in a dark quiet area.</p> <p>Place an <strong>ice
   pack</strong> on the back of the neck. Cold compresses decreases
   inflammation, slows nerve conduction and constricts blood vessels, all
   of which help reduce migraine pain.</p> <p>My doctor told me to try a
   can of regular coke and lay down in a dark room, I usually end up
   falling asleep and when I wake up it&rsquo;s gone! He said it&rsquo;s a
   ingredient in the coke that helps.</p> <p>Try the <strong>tension
   headache pills</strong> from target or Walmart. Extra strength first
   dose take 3.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll knock it out in 1 hour and won&rsquo;t
   return.</p> <p>Drink half cup <strong>coffee</strong> and half a pain
   pill.</p> <p>Try <strong>Grape Juice</strong>:<br><img

   480w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"></p> <p>Try: <strong>1
   aspirin 1 ibuprofen 1 cup coffee</strong>.</p> <p>Studies have shown
   that treatment with 600 mg of <strong>oral magnesium citrate</strong>
   per day helped reduce both the frequency and severity of migraine
   headaches. Take 600 mg of magnesium and 400 mg of B2.</p> <p>Limit
   alcohol.</p> <p>Get plenty of sleep. Seven to nine hours a night.</p>
   <p><strong>Avoid foods</strong> like foods like aged cheeses,
   chocolate, fermented food, beer, wine, hot dogs, sausage, smoked fish
   and cured meats.</p> <p>Apply <strong>peppermint essential oil</strong>
   to the temples has been shown to reduce the symptoms of tension
   headaches. Or <strong>Lavender oil</strong> to&nbsp;the upper lip and
   inhaled.</p> <p>Taking up <strong>yoga</strong> may even help reduce
   the intensity and frequency of your headaches.</p> <p><strong>Avoid
   strong odors</strong>, especially perfumes.</p> <p>Drink some
   <strong>ginger tea.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stop the migraine when it
   first starts</strong>: A friend told me: &ldquo;The doctor usually
   prescribes 800 mg&nbsp; of Ibuprofen and the one I bought from the
   store is 200 so I usually take four of those, drink a bottle of water
   and then hop in the shower. I slowly turn the water up as high as I can
   stand it and run my head and forehead under the water. I also filled my
   ears with hot water and plug them for a second then release and do that
   again. sometimes I also pull my hair from the root lightly and
   surprisingly enough it actually really helps!&rdquo;</p> <p>Another
   lady said: &ldquo;I know this is going to sound completely crazy but
   you could try <strong>aluminium foil</strong> on your forehead. I works
   for me or slices of garlic on your temples. It won&rsquo;t get rid of
   it completely but if you have already taken meds and can&rsquo;t take
   anymore give it a try.&rdquo;</p> <p>Try rubbing a
   <strong>lemon</strong> across your forehead.&nbsp; The smell soothes
   you and relaxing.&nbsp; Sudafed bc and Benadryl 2tablets each and slice
   cucumbers over eye. Then lay at the end of bed with your head handing
   over edge relives tension.</p> <p>Wear <strong>dark sunglasses</strong>
   if you have to go outside.</p> <p><strong>Migraine Formula</strong> is
   recommended by <a
   href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-64327/migraine-formula-oral/de
   tails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebMd.com </a>It is a
   combination of aspirin,&nbsp;acetaminophen, and&nbsp;caffeine.</p>
   <p>Try <strong>CBD oil</strong>. What you have to loose?</p> <p>Believe
   it or not but the thing that helps me is a <strong>pinch of cream of
   tartar</strong> under your tongue.</p> <p>Tip from a friend: When my
   son was diagnosed with migraines, his pediatrician didn&rsquo;t want to
   put him on a prescription med at 12, so he told me to give him a
   <strong>Goody&rsquo;s Headache Powder</strong> (orange flavored). It
   worked so I decided to try it for myself. I have had debilitating
   migraines since suffering a misplaced disc in a car accident.
   Goody&rsquo;s is the only thing that ever made a difference, and it
   works within 30 minutes! I have told others about it and they have also
   reported it works better than anything else.</p> <p><strong>Always
   consult your doctor before trying any remedy.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For the people saying throw it away, you haven&rsquo;t
   tried cooking your veggies and meat in bacon grease,<strong> it&rsquo;s
   a game changer!</strong> So delicious!</p> <p>Actually its animal fat
   which <strong>is a lot healthier</strong> for you than the store bought
   coconut oil or vegetable oils.&nbsp; Our bodies process the animal fats
   as it is without all the chemical additives.</p> <p><strong>Pop
   popcorn</strong> in the grease. DELICIOUS!</p> <p>Use it for
   <strong>frying eggs. </strong>&nbsp;And if your a liver eater
   it&rsquo;s really good fried in bacon grease. Tasty when making
   <strong>fresh green beans</strong> and in<strong> wilted lettuce
   salad</strong>. Great for fried potatoes. Love it for <strong>cooking
   cornbread.</strong> Put a table spoon in a <strong>cast iron
   skillet</strong>, preheated heated in the oven then pour cornbread in
   and cook.</p> <p><span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x">I cooked bacon in
   electric skillet, kept grease, used it to cook hamburg for
   <strong>Chili</strong>, BEST CHILI EVER!</span></span></p> <p>I love
   <strong>gravy with bacon grease</strong>. I substitute the butter in
   this recipe with bacon grease: <a
   href="https://myhoneysplace.com/sh-t-on-a-shingle/" rel="">Sh..T On A
   Shingle&nbsp;</a></p> <p>You can <strong>strain bacon grease into ice
   cube trays.</strong> Once frozen, pop them out into a plastic dish, and
   keep this in the freezer. When I need bacon grease, I grab one or two.
   It&rsquo;s always fresh, and one less thing on my counter.
   &nbsp;You<span dir="ltr"><span class="_3l3x _1n4g"> can preserve small
   amounts and take them out as as need. Take a plastic ice cube tray and
   line the cups with plastic wrap. After the bacon drippings have cooled
   completely, pour the grease into the lined cup. Put a piece of plastic
   wrap loosely over the whole tray and place it the fridge until you have
   solids. Wrap each piece and place them in a freezer bag. If you want
   more protection for this you can place the baggie in a container and
   place in the freezer, then you can take them out as you need them. Easy
   peasy.. NOTE: let them thaw a bit before using.</span></span></p>
   <p>Use it in <strong>peanut butter cookies</strong> in place of
   butter.</p> <p>Use to <strong>season cast iron</strong> keeps from
   rusting and makes food taste awesome.</p> <p>You can <strong>make
   soap</strong> with bacon grease:&nbsp; <a
   href="https://sustainablescientist.net/2013/03/04/making-bacon-soap/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making Bacon Soap</a></p>
   <p>Make Suet for Winter <strong>Bird Feeders</strong>: <a
   href="https://www.almanac.com/content/homemade-bird-food-recipe-suet"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homemade Suet For
   Birds</a></p> <p>Get rid of it after one month. You can <strong>store
   it</strong> in a glass jar or cleaned coffee can. Strain any meat that
   might be in the grease. Store on counter top, cabinet above your stove
   or in the refrigerator. Mine is in sealed glass jar and it never molds
   or smells rancid. It will last longer if it&rsquo;s refrigerated.
   Otherwise it gets rancid after a couple months. &nbsp;2 months on
   counter 3 months in refrigerator.</p> <p>Whatever you do, <strong>DO
   NOT put it down your drain</strong>. It will eventually clog your sink
   from build up. If must&nbsp; discard it.&nbsp; Put in tinfoil lined pan
   in refrigerator until it hardens and then throw the entire thing in
   trash. Protects your&nbsp; drain.</p> <p>In summary: stick to a simple
   rule that applies to most processed food products: <strong>moderation
   is key</strong>.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See more <a

   don&rsquo;t put them out at</strong><span
   class="text_exposed_show"><strong>&nbsp;all</strong>. Mildew forming
   inside the nectar infects their tongues, causing their tongues to
   swell, and they slowly starve to death. Then all the babies in their
   nests die as well.</span></p> <p><strong>Clean it at least least every
   3 to 4 days</strong>. For a good cleaning use some vinegar in hot water
   and rinse well. Empty your feeder and dispose of any leftover nectar.
   Use a cleaning mop, scrub away any nectar residue or mold buildup.
   Then, mix 2 parts water and&nbsp;1 part white vinegar to make
   a&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;mixture. <strong>Avoid using dish soap</strong> if
   possible since the leftover residue is bad
   for&nbsp;hummingbirds<b>.&nbsp;</b> Rinse your hummingbird feeder with
   cold water. Allow&nbsp;feeder&nbsp;to air dry before refilling.</p>
   <p>Or <strong>once a month</strong> use 1/4 cup bleach in a gallon of
   hot water, soak about 30 minutes, rinse well and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
   <p>It&rsquo;s recommended that feeders be changed and thoroughly
   cleaned every other day, but it is important that they are cleaned and
   refilled at least twice a week in hot weather (summer) and once a week
   in cooler weather (spring/fall) to prevent the growth of mold.</p>
   <p><strong>Safe Hummingbird food:</strong></p> <p>Mix 1 part table
   sugar with 4 parts water (for example, 1 cup of sugar with 4 cups of
   water) until the sugar is dissolved.</p>
   <p>Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> add red dye.</p> <p>Place mixture in
   feeder and put outside.</p> <p>Change feeder food every 3 to 4 days and
   thoroughly clean them each time to prevent harmful mold growth.</p>
   <p><strong>Just an FYI:</strong> Hummingbirds will not hurt you. They
   may come close to you but they are just exploring you. Don&rsquo;t be
   afraid of them. There are very few cases of hummingbirds attacking
   humans though, and they can&rsquo;t do much harm unless they aim for
   the eyes or other particularly vulnerable areas.</p> <p

   600px"></p> <p><strong>Do not use them with towels</strong>: Dryer
   sheets makes towels <strong>less absorbent</strong>. Avoid using dryer
   sheets when washing bath, kitchen, microfiber or cleaning towels or
   rags.</p> <p>The coating from a dryer sheet can make <strong>pajamas
   less fire resistant</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Fabric softener</strong>
   is a better choice because it doesn&rsquo;t have all the problems that
   dryer sheets have. As long as you use the right amount, clothes should
   come out soft and static-free. Use odor free softener. Don&rsquo;t use
   fabric softener on pajamas, it also will make them less fire
   resistant.</p> <p>One of the most toxic things we do, on a regular
   basis, is use dryer sheets. Those perfume-laden (even fragrance-free)
   sheets and liquid are <strong>full of toxic chemicals</strong>.</p>
   <p><strong>Replace your fabric softener or dryer sheets with</strong>
   1/4 cup of baking soda or 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the wash during
   the rinse cycle. Your clothes will feel softer and look brighter
   without any irritating chemicals. <strong>FYI:</strong> Don&rsquo;t mix
   vinegar with bleach. It creates dangerous fumes.<strong>
   FYI</strong>:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t use vinegar in front loading washers.
   The acid in the vinegar can eat through the door seal.</p>
   <p><strong>For static cling:</strong> make&nbsp;aluminum foil balls for
   your dryer. All you need is two or three foil balls made with 3 or 4
   square feet of aluminum foil each, mashed into a ball that is around 2
   to 3 inches in diameter. Once they&rsquo;re made, all you do is toss
   them in the dryer with your wet clothes.</p> <p style="text-align:

   100vw, 600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is <strong>normal</strong> to
   get <strong>dizzy</strong> when first using progressive lenses glasses.
   That is because you look down and see thru the bifocal. It will take
   some time for your eyes to adjust. But in the meantime if you have to
   do stairs or escalators <strong>use the rail so you don&rsquo;t
   fall</strong> and be careful. If you have someone with you, let them
   know that you have the bifocal and ask for help if you need it. When
   you first get them, use them only while sitting for awhile and
   gradually add walking with them .I have been thru this, <strong>it does
   get better</strong>. You will have to <strong>practice</strong> wearing
   them!</p> <p>Make sure that they are <strong>sitting correctly on your
   face</strong>. If they aren&rsquo;t you surely will have trouble. Might
   need to be adjusted around your ears. See your optometrist to adjust
   them. Most places where you bought your glasses will adjust them for
   free.</p> <p><strong>When you are walking, </strong>don&rsquo;t look
   straight down at the floor because you will trip and or fall.</p>
   <p><em>Just <strong>move your eyes not your head</strong> to look at
   things. Your eyes will look down for the bifocal and straight for the
   distant. Move your eyes up and down not your head . That&rsquo;s
   what&rsquo;s making you dizzy. It takes practice but once you get use
   to doing this every thing will clear up.</em></p> <p>Some people they
   just <strong>don&rsquo;t work</strong> well. Then you should get
   separate regular glasses, then buy readers from the drug store.</p> <p

   years. I love them because in over 20 years none of them have broken.
   You can put them in the microwave and oven.</p> <p>Now they are stained
   and ugly looking. I have scrubbed and scrubbed them and they now
   stained to the point I started to throw them away. Then I found the
   perfect way to clean them and now they look brand new.</p> <p>I use
   this method with the plates and dishes:</p> <p>Fill your sink with hot
   water and dawn dish soap. Then add 1 cup bleach. Soak for at least 2
   hours. Rinse and you will be amazed at how beautiful they are
   again.</p> <p>Guess I will keep them another 25 years.</p> <p

   <p><strong>Deodorant</strong> instantly stops the itching. For bad
   itching, grab your antiperspirant dry-stick deodorant and just swipe it
   across the bites. It seals the bite from the air and your itching will
   just stop.</p> <p>Cotton balls soaked in<strong> rubbing
   alcohol</strong>. It stops the itch and helps heal them quicker.</p>
   <p><strong>&nbsp;Vicks vapor rub</strong>. &nbsp;Smear it on pulse
   points and the mosquitoes will leave you alone. Why it works: Vicks
   VapoRub contains cedar leaf oil, which is a natural insect repellent.
   If it&rsquo;s too late to prevent mosquito bites, rubbing VapoRub on
   the bumps will also relieve your itching.</p> <p><strong>Lemon grass
   oil</strong> and water in spray bottle. They will still be around you
   but won&rsquo;t bite. It&rsquo;s all natural and can even be put on
   animals/pets because it&rsquo;s safe.</p> <p>Believe it or not
   <strong>Preparation H</strong> works. I didn&rsquo;t believe it until a
   doctor in the emergency room where I work told me about it. If you
   don&rsquo;t believe it just try it once one mosquito bite. And
   you&rsquo;ll be a believer!</p> <p>Dab a tiny bit of <strong>tea tree
   oil</strong> on each one and the swelling goes down and they stop
   itching.</p> <p>Wet your finger and rub on a bar of ordinary
   <strong>bath soap</strong> then rub on the bite takes the itch
   away.</p> <p><strong>Hand sanitizer</strong>. Rub it on the bites and
   they won&rsquo;t itch for awhile.</p> <p><span dir="ltr"><span
   class="_3l3x"><strong>Camphor-Phenique</strong> works wonders I apply
   it and they vanish.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Windex</strong>:
   It&rsquo;s the ammonia that kills the itch. It works incredibly well,
   you won&rsquo;t believe the relief!</p> <p>Strangely enough
   <strong>apple slices.</strong> I use granny smiths. Cut an apple into
   slices save 2 (eat the rest) and rub over the mosquito bites. It works
   and is chemical free.</p> <p><strong>Resist scratching</strong>, the
   less you scratch the sooner your bites will heal and not leave
   scarring.</p> <p>Use some some <strong>BIOFREEZE f</strong>or the itch
   from the bites. I have the roll on and it takes the mild swelling out
   of my feet and relieves the pain. Works great for muscle pain
   too.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say enough wonderful stuff about this
   product.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-60818"

   <p><strong>Contrary to some beliefs</strong>&nbsp;the color of an egg
   is not an indicator of quality. When it comes to taste and nutrition,
   there is no difference between white and brown eggs.</p> <p>Despite the
   fact that they&rsquo;re often&nbsp;<strong>more
   expensive</strong>,&nbsp;brown eggs&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t any&nbsp;better
   for you&nbsp;than white&nbsp;eggs, and vice versa.</p> <p>Egg color
   depends&nbsp;on the <strong>breed of the chicken</strong>. For example,
   White Leghorn chickens lay white-shelled eggs, while Plymouth Rocks and
   Rhode Island Reds lay brown-shelled eggs.</p> <p><strong>Eggs contain a
   lots of vitamins</strong>, minerals and high-quality protein, with less
   than 80 calories each.</p> <p>Eggs that are bought directly from
   <strong>small,&nbsp;local farmers&nbsp;</strong>are likely to be the
   freshest and usually come from hens that live in more natural
   environments with plenty of access to sunshine.</p> <p>If you are
   trying to&nbsp;<strong>cut back on&nbsp;calories</strong>, choose
   poached or boiled eggs.</p> <p>White eggs&nbsp;are <strong>easier to
   peel</strong> then brown.</p> <p style="text-align:

   the morning.</p> <p>General rule of thumb is about an inch or two of
   water each week with deep, infrequent watering as opposed to the more
   frequent shallow watering.</p> <p>If you live in a hot dry climate your
   plants may need more frequent watering.</p> <p style="text-align:

   week:</strong> lettuce, celery, spinach, beets, carrots, turnips,
   potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, strawberries, raspberries,
   blackberries, peas.</p> <p><strong>Once a week:</strong> beans, green
   beans, corn, peppers, eggplants, zucchini, yams, peanuts, rhubarb,
   onions, pumpkins.</p> <p><strong>Every 10 days to 2 weeks:</strong>
   tomatoes, watermelon, cantaloupes, butternut squash, banana squash,
   peaches, nectarines, pears, apples, plums, cherries, grapes,
   asparagus.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See more of our

   with 2 pillows at a time to keep your machine balanced.<br> Place in
   washing machine with <strong>HOT</strong> water. Pour 1 cup baking soda
   or white vinegar with liquid laundry soap.</p> <p>Let soak for 1 to 2
   hours.<br> Wash on heavy duty setting.</p> <p>After washing place in
   dryer with 2 tennis balls covered with a sock. This will help fluff up
   the pillows.</p> <p>Or best bet is to dry outside in direct sunlight

   flea trap using dish soap and some water. All you have to do is fill a
   plate or bowl with a mixture of warm water and dish soap and place it
   in the rooms of your house which receive the most flea activity. The
   water and dish soap solutions act as a glue, trapping the fleas due to
   the high viscosity of the solution. You should repeat this method with
   a fresh batch every day.</div> </li></ul></div></div> </div></div> <p

   infections:</span> Use vitamin E oil and massage it into inflamed
   skin.</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cat hair balls:</span> Give
   them a spoon full of butter or vegetable oil.</p> <p><span
   style="color: #ff0000;">Homemade shampoo:</span> Animals should not use
   human shampoo. Mix dish soap with water and white distilled
   vinegar.</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Diarrhea:</span> Mix
   plain yogurt with their food.</p> <p><span style="color:
   #ff0000;">Stinky gas:</span> Sprinkle some fennel seed in their food
   once a day.</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bee sting:</span> Use
   a credit card to pull out the stinger then wash with baking soda. If
   they have an allergic reaction to the sting, then give 1 mg per 1 pound
   ratio of Benadryl.</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Skunk
   spray:</span> Bathe your pet in hydrogen peroxide mixed with baking
   soda and dish soap.Then soak in tomato juice for several minutes.</p>
   <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Irritated&nbsp; eyes:</span> Use
   regular saline eye drops several times a day,</p> <p><span
   style="color: #ff0000;">Ear mites:</span> Clean the ears with a cotton
   ball dipped in regular vegetable oil and wipe gently.</p> <p><span
   style="color: #ff0000;">Sores:</span> Clip the fur around the area,
   clean with hydrogen peroxide then put a small amount of cortisone cream
   to the sore. Do this two times a day.</p> <p><span style="color:
   #ff0000;">Fleas:</span> Wash in dish soap and water then gently run a
   comb gently through their fur.</p> <p><span style="color:
   #ff0000;">Sore or cracked paws:</span> Use lotion and antibiotic
   ointment.</p> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Itchy skin</span>:
   Combine baby oatmeal with water then rub into fur.</p> <p>Use <span
   style="color: #ff0000;">metal bowls</span> to feed your pets. Metal
   bowls tend to collect less bacteria than plastic bowls.</p> <p><span
   style="color: #ff0000;">Constipation:</span> Use purred pumpkin or
   prunes every few days. Just be sure to remove the pits.</p> <p><span
   style="color: #ff0000;">If any symptoms last more than 3 days contact
   your veterinarian.</span></p></body></html> <div class='code-block

   100vw, 600px"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Auto repair shops</strong>
   will go away.&nbsp; A gasoline engine has 20,000 individual
   parts.&nbsp; An electrical motor has 20.&nbsp; Electric cars are sold
   with lifetime guarantees and are only repaired by dealers.&nbsp; It
   takes only 10 minutes to remove and replace an electric motor.&nbsp;
   Faulty electric motors are not repaired in the dealership but are sent
   to a regional repair shop that repairs them with robots.&nbsp; Your
   electric motor malfunction light goes on, so you drive up to what looks
   like a Jiffy-auto wash, and your car is towed through while you have a
   cup of coffee and out comes your car with a new electric motor!</p>
   <p><strong>Gas stations</strong> will go away.&nbsp; Parking meters
   will be replaced by meters that dispense electricity.&nbsp; Companies
   will install electrical recharging stations; in fact, they&rsquo;ve
   already started.&nbsp; You can find them at select Dunkin Donuts
   locations.</p> <p>Most (the smart) major auto manufacturers have
   already designated money to start building new plants that only build
   electric cars.</p> <p><strong>Coal industries</strong> will go
   away.&nbsp; Gasoline/oil companies will go away.&nbsp; Drilling for oil
   will stop.&nbsp; So say goodbye to OPEC!</p> <p>Homes will produce and
   store more electrical energy during the day and then they use and will
   sell it back to the grid. The grid stores it and dispenses it to
   industries that are high electricity users.&nbsp; Has anybody seen the
   Tesla roof?</p> <p>A baby of today will only see personal cars in
   museums.</p> <p><strong>The FUTURE</strong> is approaching faster than
   most of us can handle.</p> <p>In 1998, <strong>Kodak</strong> had
   170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.&nbsp;
   Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went
   bankrupt.&nbsp; Who would have thought of that ever happening?</p>
   <p>What happened to Kodak will happen in a lot of industries in the
   next 5-10 years and, most people don&rsquo;t see it coming.</p> <p>Did
   you think in 1998 that 3 years later, you would never take pictures on
   film again?&nbsp; With today&rsquo;s smart phones, who even has a
   camera these days?</p> <p>Yet <strong>digital cameras</strong> were
   invented in 1975.&nbsp; The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but
   followed Moore&rsquo;s law.&nbsp; So as with all exponential
   technologies, it was a disappointment for a time, before it became way
   superior and became mainstream in only a few short years.&nbsp; It will
   now happen again (but much faster) with Artificial Intelligence,
   health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing,
   agriculture and jobs.</p> <p>Forget the book, &ldquo;Future
   Shock&rdquo;, welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.</p>
   <p><strong>Software</strong> has disrupted and will continue to disrupt
   most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.</p>
   <p><strong>UBER</strong> is just a software tool, they don&rsquo;t own
   any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world!&nbsp; Ask
   any taxi driver if they saw that coming.</p> <p><strong>Airbnb</strong>
   is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they
   don&rsquo;t own any properties.&nbsp; Ask Hilton Hotels if they saw
   that coming.</p> <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Computers
   become exponentially better in understanding the world.&nbsp; This
   year, a computer beat the best Go-player in the world, 10 years earlier
   than expected.</p> <p>In the USA, young lawyers already don&rsquo;t get
   jobs.&nbsp; Because of IBM&rsquo;s Watson, you can get legal advice (so
   far for right now, the basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy
   compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans.&nbsp; So, if you study
   law, stop immediately.&nbsp; There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the
   future, (what a thought!) only omniscient specialists will remain.</p>
   <p>Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, its 4 times more
   accurate than human nurses.</p> <p><strong>Facebook</strong> now has a
   pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than
   humans.&nbsp; In 2030, computers will become more intelligent than
   humans.</p> <p><strong>Autonomous cars</strong>: In 2018 the first
   self-driving cars are already here.&nbsp; In the next 2 years, the
   entire industry will start to be disrupted.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t want
   to own a car anymore as you will call a car with your phone, it will
   show up at your location and drive you to your destination.&nbsp; You
   will not need to park it you will only pay for the driven distance and
   you can be productive while driving.&nbsp; The very young children of
   today will never get a driver&rsquo;s license and will never own a
   car.</p> <p>This will change our cities, because we will need 90-95%
   fewer cars.&nbsp; We can transform former parking spaces into
   parks.</p> <p>1.2 million people die each year in car accidents
   worldwide including distracted or drunk driving.&nbsp; We now have one
   accident every 60,000 miles; with autonomous driving that will drop to
   1 accident in 6 million miles.&nbsp; That will save a million lives
   plus worldwide each year.</p> <p>Most traditional car companies will
   doubtless become bankrupt.&nbsp; Traditional car companies will try the
   evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies
   (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach<br> and build
   a computer on wheels.</p> <p>Look at what <strong>Volvo</strong> is
   doing right now; no more internal combustions engines in their vehicles
   starting this year with the 2019 models, using all electric or hybrid
   only, with the intent of phasing out hybrid models.</p> <p>Many
   engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; are completely terrified of
   <strong>Tesla</strong> and so they should be.&nbsp; Look at all the
   companies offering all electric vehicles.&nbsp; That was unheard of,
   only a few years ago.</p> <p><strong>Insurance companies</strong> will
   have massive trouble because, without accidents, the costs will become
   cheaper.&nbsp; Their car insurance business model will disappear.</p>
   <p><strong>Real estate</strong> will change.&nbsp; Because if you can
   work while you commute, people will move farther away to live in a more
   beautiful or affordable neighborhood.</p> <p><strong>Electric
   cars</strong> will become mainstream about 2030. Cities will be less
   noisy because all new cars will run on electricity.</p> <p>Cities will
   have much cleaner air as well. (Can we start in Los Angeles,
   please?)</p> <p><strong>Electricity</strong> will become incredibly
   cheap and clean.&nbsp; Solar production has been on an exponential
   curve for 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact.&nbsp;
   And it&rsquo;s just getting ramped up.</p> <p><strong>Fossil energy
   companies</strong> are desperately trying to limit access to the grid
   to prevent competition from home solar installations, but that simply
   cannot continue &ndash; technology will take care of that strategy.</p>
   <p><strong>Health:</strong> The Tricorder X price will be announced
   this year.&nbsp; There are companies who will build a medical device
   (called the &ldquo;Tricorder&rdquo; from Star Trek) that works with
   your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you
   breathe into it.&nbsp; It then analyses 54 bio-markers that will
   identify nearly any Disease&nbsp; There are dozens of phone apps out
   there right now for health purposes.</p> <p><strong>WELCOME TO
   TOMORROW</strong> &ndash; it actually arrived a few years
   ago.</p></body></html> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   100vw, 600px"></p> <p><strong>Cold compress:</strong><br> A cold
   compress will help the hemorrhoids to shrink and become small in size.
   It will reduce pain and provide instant relief from itching. It will be
   easier to pass stools once swelling is reduced. Wrap some ice in a
   clean cloth and apply it directly over the hemorrhoids. Doing this
   several times, a day will help to constrict the blood vessels and
   reduce hemorrhoids effectively. Also sitting on a cushion rather than a
   hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and
   prevents the formation of new ones.</p>
   <p><strong>Hydration:</strong><br> Dryness may aggravate hemorrhoids
   and may cause excessive bleeding. Never use a dry tissue to wipe the
   affected area as it may cause unwanted scratches that can worsen the
   swollen vessels. Instead use a non-perfumed, non-medicated wet tissue
   to wipe off without drying out your skin. You may also place vitamin E
   capsules in the opening of the anus to soothe the area and re-hydrate
   it.</p> <p><strong>Take warm baths:</strong></p> <p>Soak in a bathtub
   filled with a few inches of warm water for about 15 minutes at a time.
   Do it two or three times a day and after every bowel movement. If you
   want to wash the area, too, use unscented soap and don&rsquo;t
   scrub.</p> <p><strong>Witch Hazel:</strong></p> <p>Witch hazel is
   reputed to reduce pain, itching and bleeding until hemorrhoids fade
   out. There isn&rsquo;t much scientific support for its use but it does
   contain tannins and oils that may help bring down inflammation and slow
   bleeding. Supporters say it tightens the skin as a natural
   anti-inflammatory.&nbsp;Witch hazel wipes (Tucks) are soothing and have
   no harmful effects.</p> <p><strong>Pure Aloe Vera:</strong></p> <p>The
   anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera may help soothe inflammation
   of hemorrhoids.</p> <p><strong>Petroleum Jelly:</strong></p> <p>Put a
   little petroleum jelly just inside your rectum to make your bowel
   movements hurt less. Don&rsquo;t force it! Dab witch hazel
   on&nbsp;irritated&nbsp;hemorrhoids, or use over-the-counter creams or
   ointments made for hemorrhoid symptoms. A 1% hydrocortisone cream on
   the skin outside the rectum (not inside) can relieve&nbsp;itching,
   too.</p> <p><strong>Get more fiber:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Add more
   fiber to your diet from food, a fiber supplement (such as Metamucil,
   Citrucel, or Fiber Con), or both. Along with adequate fluid, fiber
   softens stools and makes them easier to pass, reducing pressure on
   hemorrhoids. High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat
   bran, whole-grain foods, and fresh fruit.</p> <p><strong>OTC
   Meds:</strong></p> <p>Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such
   as&nbsp;acetaminophen&nbsp;<i class="eld i-exit-nih" aria-label="NIH
   external link"></i>,&nbsp;ibuprofen&nbsp;<i class="eld i-exit-nih"
   aria-label="NIH external link"></i>,&nbsp;naproxen&nbsp;<i class="eld
   i-exit-nih" aria-label="NIH external link"></i>, or aspirin will lessen
   the pain and reduce the swelling.</p> <p><em>Some hemorrhoids
   can&rsquo;t be managed with conservative treatments alone, either
   because symptoms persist or because an internal hemorrhoid has
   prolapsed. Contact your doctor if your hemorrhoids are severe or
   symptoms not relieved within a week.</em></p> <p style="text-align:

   600px"></p> <p><strong>Meat:</strong> Place fresh meat into a zip lock
   bag leaving a small opening at the side of the bag. Then submerge in a
   bowl of water up to the top of the bag, and completely seal the top.
   Meat will be vacuum sealed ready to freeze.</p>
   <p><strong>Strawberries:</strong> Mix a bowl of 3 parts water with 1
   part apple cider vinegar. Take the strawberries that are still in the
   plastic container and dip them into the water mixture. Shake off excess
   water and store in the refrigerator. Days later your strawberries will
   still be fresh.</p> <p><strong>Bread:</strong> Add a celery stick to a
   fresh loaf of bread. This will help prevent moldy bread and keep it
   fresh longer.</p> <p><strong>To Soften Cookies:</strong> Place hard
   cookies in a resealable container. Add a slice of bread and reseal.
   Days later the cookies will soften.</p> <p><strong>Slow down milk from
   spoiling</strong>: When you open fresh milk add 1 teaspoon salt and
   shake the container. Several days later the milk will still be
   fresh.</p> <p><strong>Bananas:</strong> Wrap the top stems of a bunch
   of bananas with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. A week later they will
   still be fresh. This will slow down the browning process.</p>
   <p><strong>Potatoes:</strong> Place an apple in the bag of potatoes.
   The bag of potatoes will stay sprout free and firm for eight weeks.</p>
   <p><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Store outside of the refrigerator with
   the stem side down. Will make your tomatoes last longer.</p>
   <p><strong>Wilted salad</strong>: Wrap the wilted salad in a clean
   kitchen towel. Store in an airtight plastic container. The kitchen
   towel will absorb the moisture and make your greens crisper. You can
   also place the wilted green in a bowl of ice water making them look
   fresh again.</p></body></html> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   flavor without the need for sugar.&nbsp;This is a coffee drink loaded
   with flavor, it&rsquo;s filling and satisfying.</p> <p>It keeps you
   feeling full.</p> <p>Speeds up your metabolism because it makes your
   system burn fat.</p> <p>It also keeps your energy level up all day
   because it enhances the effect of caffeine.</p> <p>Butter is digested
   faster than other fats, so it boosts energy and promotes weight
   loss.</p> <p>The butter turns off some of your food cravings and
   provides things the brain needs.</p> <p>Butter could slow the
   absorption of caffeine into the bloodstream. This would result in a
   prolonged energy boost rather than the peak and crash you might
   experience if you drank your coffee without the fat.</p> <p>You should
   drink this mix <strong>3 times a week</strong> at the most in order to
   feel your best.</p> <p><strong>Use unsalted
   butter.</strong></p></body></html> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   Garden Soil NOW.</strong> You don&rsquo;t have to wait for spring to
   get your soil ready for your garden. Awesome DIY ideas.</p>
   <p><strong>Egg Shells:</strong> Use an empty milk bottle with a lid.
   Every time you use eggs, put the shells in the bottle. When almost full
   of egg shells fill it with water. Keep the lid on. After 6 months water
   it into the garden on a rainy day.</p> <p><strong>Use farm
   compost</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span data-ft='{"tn":"K"}'><span
   class="UFICommentBody">Poultry, ducks, chicken, rabbit, geese droppings
   are very good fertilizer.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p>Throw all your
   <strong>vegetable scraps</strong> straight into the garden. Including
   avocado peels and pits, coffee grounds, used tea, sour milk, peanut
   shells.</p> <p><strong>Epson salt</strong>: Use on&nbsp;on tomatoes,
   peppers, and roses to&nbsp;grow&nbsp;stronger plants with more blossoms
   and sweeter tasting vegetables.</p> <p><strong>Coffee
   grounds:</strong>&nbsp;Add used&nbsp;coffee grounds&nbsp;directly to
   the soil in your garden. You can it into the top couple inches of soil,
   or just sprinkle the&nbsp;grounds&nbsp;on top and leave it
   alone.&nbsp;Coffee grounds&nbsp;encourage microbes to grow
   in&nbsp;the&nbsp;soil.&nbsp;Mix used coffee grounds with yard waste
   like dead leaves or dry straw and grass clippings to add nitrogen to
   the soil.</p> <p><iframe

   <p><strong>On the back of the bill</strong> is and eagle is holding 13
   arrows and an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives.<br> The
   eagle&rsquo;s shield has 13 vertical stripes and 13 horizontal stripes.
   The number 13 represents the<strong> <a
   href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/usstates/co
   lonies.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original 13
   colonies.</a></strong></p> <p>On the back at the <strong>bottom of the
   pyramid</strong> is a long series of roman numerals: MDCCLXXVI. The
   numerals stand for the number 1776, the year america declared
   independence.</p> <p><strong>Eye at the top of the pyramid</strong>.
   The eye represents the presence of God watching over America. Those who
   like conspiracy theories, believe that the &ldquo;all-seeing eye&rdquo;
   is a symbol of the Freemasonry. The <strong><a
   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry"
   rel="">Freemasonry</a></strong> were once a secret fraternity, and many
   believe our Founding Fathers were members of the Freemasons. They are
   called Masons today.&nbsp;The all-seeing eye shaped like the top of the
   pyramid is an ancient symbol of divinity.</p> <p><strong>The hidden
   creature</strong> might just be too small for you to spot without
   taking out a magnifying glass. In the upper-right corner of the bill,
   just to the upper-left of the number &ldquo;1&rdquo;, there appears to
   be a teeny-tiny creature peeking out. There are several guesses as to
   what this is. Some say that this is the shape of an owl. Many believe
   it was put there as an anti-counterfeit measure. Others, however,
   don&rsquo;t see an owl at all; they see a spider. Some argue a hidden
   spider would make much more sense, given the &ldquo;web&rdquo; pattern
   behind the number &ldquo;1.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>The 1 on the back
   side corners</strong>. The&nbsp;&nbsp;cross or windmill-like shape
   behind the number 1.&nbsp;Many believe that this symbol is the shape
   known as the Maltese cross.&nbsp; Some believe to be a hidden reference
   to the famed <strong><a
   href="https://www.orderofmalta.int/sovereign-order-of-malta/knights-of-
   malta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knights of
   Malta.</a></strong></p> <p><strong>The pyramid</strong> on the dollar
   bill represents strength and duration.</p> <p><strong>The
   Eagle</strong> on a dollar bill is a shield, which is unsupported to
   signify Americans should rely on their own virtue.</p> <p><strong>The
   balancing scales</strong> on the Department of Treasury seal represents
   a symbol of justice.</p> <p><strong>Latin phrases</strong> appear a few
   times on the dollar bill. Above the pyramid reads &ldquo;annuit
   coeptis,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;God has favored our undertaking.
   Under the pyramid is the phrase &ldquo;novus ordo seclorum,&rdquo;
   which is interpreted as &ldquo;a new order of the ages.&rdquo; On the
   banner the eagle holds, &ldquo;e pluribus unum,&rdquo; which means
   &ldquo;out of many, one.&rdquo;</p></body></html> <div

   To Get Rid Of Fruit Flies</strong>. If you have problems with fruit
   flies try these ideas:</p> <p>Fruit flies are small flies that&nbsp;lay
   their eggs near the surface of fermenting foods or other moist, organic
   materials. Fruit flies&nbsp;are especially attracted to
   ripened&nbsp;fruits&nbsp;and vegetables in the kitchen. But they also
   will breed in drains, garbage disposals, empty bottles and cans, trash
   containers, mops and cleaning rags.</p> <p><strong>The first step is to
   get rid of what is attracting them</strong>. Put all the apples,
   potatoes and onions in the fridge. Clean your sink, garbage disposal,
   trash can thoroughly. Make sure your trash can has a lid.&nbsp; Rinse
   your mops and cleaning rags with bleach water.</p> <p><strong>Pour hot
   water and bleach down your drains at night.</strong> Cover the drain
   with a bowl or dish. They breed in moist area&rsquo;s. Sink drains are
   a magnet for the pest.</p> <p><strong>Rinse out your beer/soda
   cans</strong> and wine bottles before throwing them away. This really
   attracts the monsters!</p> <p><strong>Get a bowl with sweet balsamic
   vinegar</strong> in it mixed with water say 1:5 vinegar and water. Put
   a squirt of dish soap in it, give it a stir. Leave it out. They will be
   attracted to the sweet vinegar but the soap breaks the surface tension
   of the liquid and they fall in.</p> <p><strong>Set out a glass of
   wine</strong> or something sweet and they will all collect in the
   drink.&nbsp;Take a bowl and place some wine into it, place saran wrap
   over it and pierce small holes into the wrap and place over the bowl.
   The gnats can get in but not out and drown in the fermenting wine.
   Works like a charm!</p> <p><strong>They could be from live inside
   plants</strong>. I went&nbsp; through that some time ago turned out it
   was the soil from the plants is where they were coming from I threw
   them all out problem solved.</p> <p><strong>Do a mix of all theses
   ideas?</strong> Find the room that has the most. I found its best to
   use a container that has a &ldquo;neck&rdquo; like water bottle, soap
   or beer bottle, etc to mix the solution. It can be anything that is
   going to smell strong, the soap is to stick&nbsp;to them, put 2 or 3 in
   room with most. Then 1 in each room. Pour stuff in drains. I had
   chemical pneumonia once from bleach so I use windex now in my drains.
   Take out all trash. Move plants out or put all in one room and close
   door. They will multiply very quickly, like in 1 day. My neighbor found
   her source by shutting doors to all rooms, bathrooms closet, then found
   they were all gone except 1 room so after hunting for source, Found
   them in unopened bag of dog food. But bag had a small rip in it and
   they loved it.</p></body></html> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   water. Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the actual water. Bring
   the water to the boil then turn it down to a simmer. Very slowly melt
   the cacao butter in the bowl of the double boiler. Take the cacao
   butter to no higher than 4045C/104113F. If you think it is getting too
   hot but hasnt all melted, take it off the heat to finish melting. It is
   important not to overheat it or the chocolate will taste grainy and be
   bloomed, with a white cloudy appearance. When the cacao butter has
   melted and is at around 4045C/104113F, add the rest of the ingredients.
   This should lower the temperature and we now want to bring it down to
   2830C/8286F; just above or below will be fine.</div> </li><li

   are there tips that non-professionals can use on a daily basis?</p>
   <p>Psychology is a science with certain laws one cannot ignore. Modern

   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>SUMMARY:</p> <p>Never start your request with the
   words &ldquo;Could you&hellip;&rdquo; It can cause the other person to
   subconsciously assume that this is a theoretical question</p> <p>If you
   ever want someone to feel uncomfortable, look at the middle of their
   forehead during the conversation.</p> <p>If someone you&rsquo;re
   talking to is trying to avoid answering a question, just make a pause
   in the conversation while still keeping eye contact.</p> <p>When asking
   a question that you want an affirmative answer to, try to nod subtly as
   you make your request. This trick is often used by restaurants
   employees to make guests buy more food, and it&rsquo;s pretty
   effective!</p> <p>If a person is really concentrated on a task
   (let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re in the middle of a serious phone
   conversation), you can extend your hand to them and get anything
   they&rsquo;re holding at the moment.</p> <p>If you want somebody to do
   something for you, casually say how they probably wouldn&rsquo;t even
   be able to do it. Most people will try really hard to prove someone
   wrong when it comes to doubting their capabilities.</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s
   a good one for negotiations. If you like a person&rsquo;s offer in
   general but would like to get better conditions, pretend to be a little
   bit disappointed.</p> <p>As soon as your alarm clock goes off, sit up,
   make two fists, and yell &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; as if you&rsquo;re a
   soccer player who&rsquo;s just scored a goal. It sounds bizarre, but it
   really does help you easily get out of bed feeling refreshed.</p> <p>If
   a person tries to pull you into an argument or some drama, say
   something nice to them. The ol&rsquo; &ldquo;kill &lsquo;em with
   kindness&rdquo; trick really does stop them in their tracks.</p> <p>If
   you have that one lazy person on your team that slows the whole work
   process down, don&rsquo;t give them tasks by saying &ldquo;Do
   this.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s better to say &ldquo;Start with
   this.&rdquo;</p> <p>If someone is staring at you in the subway (happens
   all-too often, right?), just look at their shoes. Don&rsquo;t give up,
   keep gazing! It&rsquo;ll drive them crazy!</p> <p>If someone has done
   something wrong, but you don&rsquo;t wanna sound too accusing, change
   the way you construct your sentences.</p> <p>If you didn&rsquo;t get a
   good night&rsquo;s sleep, tell yourself that you did. I know, it sounds
   like nonsense, but it does work 100% if you say it with meaning!</p>
   <p>People are better at remembering what happened at the beginning and
   end of the day. As for anything that went on in between, it gets
   blurry.</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   <p><strong>20+ DIY Shoe Hacks.</strong> Have you ever wondered how to
   prevent blisters, prevent squeaky shoes, widen your boot shafts, get
   rid of stinky feet, when to buy shoes and much more.</p> <p><strong>To
   prevent blisters:</strong> Get a bit of clear gel deodorant, and rub
   the inner heel of your shoes.</p> <p><strong>Prevent squeaky
   shoes:</strong>&nbsp;Grab a bit of baby powder and put some underneath
   your inner shoe sole. It&rsquo;ll allow for better cohesion between
   both parts of the shoe.</p> <p><strong>How to widen your boot
   shafts</strong>:&nbsp;All you need is a couple of newspapers. Simply
   stuff the shafts with the papers, and pull them out when you want to
   use your boots. Simple as that!</p> <p><img class="aligncenter

   stinky shoes</strong>:&nbsp;Put unused tea bags in your shoes, as
   they&rsquo;re absolutely great at absorbing unpleasant scents.</p>
   <p><strong>Widen your shoe toes:</strong>&nbsp;Grab an airtight bag
   filled with a little bit of water, and stick it in the toe area. Let
   your shoes rest in the freezer overnight. Because water expands when it
   becomes ice, the shoe toes will be a little bit wider than before.</p>
   <p><strong>Get rid of water stains on leather shoes:</strong> Vinegar
   and toothbrush duo is all you need to keep these ugly stains away.</p>

   sweat in your shoes:</strong> It may sound like a weird thought, but
   panty liners are great at absorbing sweat. Less sweat in your shoes
   equals less smelly odors, and it&rsquo;ll naturally keep your shoes
   fresher longer. Simply put them in the soles, and you&rsquo;re all
   done.</p> <p><strong>Chafing heals:</strong> Coat your heels with a
   layer of K-Y Jelly first to prevent chafing.</p> <p><strong>Fixing
   scuffs:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Apply some petroleum jelly on a cotton
   swab, and rub gently until the scuff is gone. Works best on a patent
   leather shoe.</p> <p><strong>How to get rid of moisture in wet
   shoes:</strong>&nbsp;Grab a couple of old newspaper pages (or paper
   towels) to keep your shoes nice and dry.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter

   fix the bottom of flip flops</strong>:&nbsp;Instead of throwing a
   broken flip-flop in the trash, grab a bread tag or a flat washer for an
   easy and quick fix.</p> <p><strong>To keep your heels from
   hurting:</strong>&nbsp;Try wearing your normal socks over a thinner
   pair of socks or nylons. The two socks will slide across one another
   and can reduce the amount of friction that occurs directly onto the
   skin of your heel.</p> <p><strong>Whiten the bottom sides of your
   sneakers:</strong> Use nail polish remover.</p> <p><strong>How to wash
   your sneakers</strong>:&nbsp;In your tub, mix two cups of vinegar with
   two gallons of water and submerge your dirty, smelly sneakers. Wash
   them as normal afterwards and find that the smell and hard stains are
   gone!</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59880 size-thumbnail"

   with determination. One of my favorite diets is to just <strong>cut out
   bread</strong> and/or sweets from your diet. My daughter lost 10 pounds
   by just cutting out bread from her diet. Take the bread from your
   hamburger and just eat the meat. Make meals without bread. Eat soups

   <p><strong>Keto Diet</strong>:&nbsp;The ketogenic ( Keto for short)
   diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet.&nbsp;It involves drastically
   reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. Research shows
   that the ketogenic diet is far superior to the often
   recommended&nbsp;low-fat diet&nbsp;.What&rsquo;s more, the diet is so
   filling that you can&nbsp;lose weight&nbsp;without counting calories or
   tracking your food intake. Read more about a <a

   <p><strong>The Atkins diet</strong>, or Atkins nutritional approach,
   focuses on controlling the levels of insulin in the body through a
   low-carbohydrate diet. If people consume large amounts of refined
   carbohydrates, their insulin levels rise and fall rapidly. Rising
   insulin levels trigger the body to store energy from the food that is
   consumed, making it less likely that the body will use stored fat as a
   source of energy. Therefore, people on the Atkins diet avoid
   carbohydrates but can eat as much protein and fat as they like.
   Although popular for some time, the Atkins Diet comes with certain
   risks. Individuals considering the Atkins Diet should speak with their
   doctor. <strong>Read more about the <a

   5 to 6 cups fresh snow, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon
   vanilla.</p> <p>4. When making <strong>biscuits</strong> cut out as
   many biscuits as possible from first roll of the dough. The more you
   roll out the dough the tougher the biscuits will be.</p> <p>5. To
   <strong>bake bacon</strong>: put it on aluminum foil, heat oven to 400
   degrees and bake for 12 minutes.</p> <p>6. If your recipe says to
   preheat <strong>oven</strong> to 400 degrees, you should put it to 425
   degrees and decrease to 400 degrees when you put your dish in. You lose
   oven heat when you open the door.</p> <p>7. Fresh
   <strong>celery</strong> will keep for weeks if you wrap the entire
   stalk in aluminum foil and put in the refrigerator.</p> <p><div

   rel="">HERE</a> for great cookie recipes </strong></p></div></p> <p>8.
   If you want <strong>cookies</strong> to remain chewy, don&rsquo;t over
   bake. Always bake the minimum amount of time.</p> <p>9. Running
   <strong>bacon</strong> under cold water before cooking will reduce
   shrinking by up to 50 percent.</p> <p>10.<strong> Potatoes</strong>
   should be mashed using warm milk only. Cold milk will make the potatoes
   turn grey.</p> <p>11. Cool<strong> cookies and cakes</strong> on a wire
   rack, because if you leave them in a pan, the heat from the pan will
   continue to the point where it is overdone.</p> <p>12. To make 8
   <strong>grilled cheese</strong> sandwiches at once, place them on a
   cookie sheet and put another cookie sheet on top.&nbsp; The sandwich
   bread comes out crispy and the cheese gooey.</p> <p>13. Don&rsquo;t
   throw away those over ripe <strong>bananas</strong>. Antioxidants
   increase in fruit the longer the ripen. Use in smoothies and banana
   bread.</p> <p>14. Cool <strong>cakes</strong> upside down on cooling
   rack. Once they are cooled you will have a flat surface to frost.</p>
   <p>15. To prevent <strong>pie crust</strong> from being tough, roll out
   dough on a surface dusted with confectioners sugar.</p> <p><div

   <p>16. To bake more <strong>cupcakes</strong> at once: After putting
   the mix in a paper cup liner, use canning jar lids on a cookie sheet
   instead of muffin pans.</p> <p>17<strong>. Out of eggs</strong>? You
   can substitute 1 egg by using 1/4 cup applesauce or 1/4 cup mashed
   banana.</p> <p>18. When cooking<strong> steaks or meat</strong>, do not
   use a fork to turn the meat. Use cooking tong or spatula to keep the
   juices from leaking.</p> <p>19. Use a large muffin tin to bake<strong>
   stuffed pepper</strong>. It will keep them upright and in place.</p>

   Life</strong><br /> Ever wonder why Dawn Dish washing Liquid is the
   wildlife cleaner of choice after an oil spill? According to the
   International Bird Rescue Research Center, Dawn effectively removes
   grease but does not cause harm to the skin of the birds. It&rsquo;s
   also biodegradable and contains no phosphates.</p>
   <p><strong>BUBBLES</strong><br /> Dawn dish washing liquid makes great
   homemade bubbles. Here is the Giant Bubble Recipe used in bubble makers
   at many children&rsquo;s museums: 1/2 cup Ultra Dawn 1/2 gallon warm
   water 1 tablespoon glycerin (available at any drug store) OR White Karo
   syrup works too! Stir gently. Skim the foam off the top of the solution
   (too much foam breaks down the bubbles). Dip bubble wand and get ready
   for some good, clean fun!</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59779

   PROBLEMS</strong><br /> Kids get into the darnedest things! Like
   Vaseline and baby oil rubbed into their hair! Dawn is mild enough to
   use on their hair and strong enough to remove the most stubborn
   grease.</p> <p><strong>HAIR PRODUCT BUILDUP</strong><br /> Once a month
   use original Dawn as you would shampoo. It will remove excess oil from
   your hair and scalp and strip away any build-up of styling products
   without any damage. Perform this once a month and you won&rsquo;t have
   to buy expensive salon products that do the same thing.</p>
   <p><strong>MANICURE SECRET</strong><br /> Soak fingers in full-strength
   blue Dawn. It makes the cuticles soft and easy to work with. And it
   removes the natural oil from the fingernails, which allows the polish
   to adhere very well.</p> <p><strong>REPEL HOUSEPLANT
   INSECTS</strong><br /> A safe, effective way to repel insects from your
   houseplants, including aphids, spider mites and mealy bugs. Put a drop
   of Dawn Dish washing Liquid in a spray bottle, fill the rest of the
   bottle with water, shake well, and mist your household plants with the
   soapy water.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59776 size-medium"

   drops Dawn in 1 gallon water and fill a spray bottle with the solution.
   Spritz and wipe as you would with any window cleaner.</p>
   <p><strong>PETS AND PESTS</strong><br /> Use it to bathe the dogs. It
   kills fleas on contact and is much cheaper than expensive dog
   shampoos.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59775 size-medium"

   TOOLS</strong><br /> After you have finished your automotive repair
   project, soak your dirty tools in Dawn before you put them away to
   remove all the oil and grime. Dawn also helps prevent rust from forming
   on the tools.</p> <p><strong>ICE PACK</strong><br /> Partially fill a
   strong zip-type sandwich bag with Dawn dish washing liquid, close and
   freeze. The liquid soap stays cold much longer and it can be re-frozen
   many times. It will conform to the place you need an ice pack.</p>
   <p><strong>TUB AND SHOWER CLEANER</strong><br /> Take a spray bottle
   and fill it halfway with white vinegar. Heat in the microwave. Fill the
   rest of the way with blue Dawn. Put lid on and shake to mix well. Spray
   on your tub and shower walls. Allow to sit for a few minutes and rinse
   away. It will totally melt all the gunk, slime, sludge and other stuff
   that builds up including a bathtub ring.</p> <p><div

   ANTS</strong><br /> Spray counter-tops, cupboards and any other area
   where you see ants with a solution of Dawn and water. Wipe dry. The
   slight residue of Dawn that remains will not be a problem at all for
   kids or pets, but ants hate it. Should you see a trail of ants, go

   oily residue. Be sure to rinse, rinse, rinse until the water runs

   IVY</strong><br /> Poison ivy spreads through the spread of the oil
   within the blisters. Washing the affected area with Dawn, especially on
   children who keep scratching the blister&rsquo;s open, helps dry up the
   fluid, AND keep it from spreading.</p> <p><strong>DRIVEWAY
   CLEANER</strong><br /> If you have gasoline or motor oil stains on your
   driveway, you can use the kitty litter method to clean up the excess
   oil and then use a scrub broom and a solution of biodegradable Dawn
   dish washing detergent and warm water to safely and effectively remove
   excess motor oil from the pavement.</p> <p><strong>OILY
   SKIN</strong><br /> Dawn makes a great facial cleanser for oily skin. A
   drop or two combined with warm water will do the trick.</p>
   <p><strong>PAINT OR GREASE REMOVER FOR HANDS</strong><br /> Dawn
   combined with corn oil makes for the perfect paint or grease remover.
   Simply combine a little bit of both in your hands then rub it over
   affected areas. The corn oil and the dish washing liquid both help to
   dissolve the grease and paint &ndash; yet leave skin soft, unlike
   harsher paint removers.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59783

   KIDDIE POOL</strong><br /> Plastic wading pools can get very gunky,
   very fast. Dump the water, then scrub the pool with Dawn and a sponge.
   More potent cleaners like bleach will weaken and dry out the plastic in
   the sun.</p> <p><strong>MULTIPURPOSE CLEANER</strong><br /> Merry Maids
   recommends using a drop of Dawn in water to clean ceramic tile and
   no-wax/linoleum floors. You can also use the spray on:<br /> &bull;
   Bathroom and kitchen counters and sinks.<br /> &bull; Woodwork, e.g.,
   baseboards, shelves, and wainscoting. (Dry as you go&ndash;wood
   doesn&rsquo;t like prolonged contact with water.)<br /> &bull; Tubs and
   toilet seats.</p> <p><strong>LAUNDRY PRE-TREATER FOR OILY
   STAINS</strong><br /> For oil-based stains such as lipstick, grease,
   butter, motor oil, cooking oil, and some pen inks, simply apply some
   Dawn dish washing liquid directly to the stain and scrub with a small
   brush or toothbrush until the oil is removed, and then launder as
   usual.</p> <p><strong>NON-TOXIC LUBRICANT</strong><br /> Sliding glass
   doors, door knobs, hinges etc. It lasts much longer than any aerosol
   type spray that I have tried. And Its non-toxic! It does a great job of
   cleaning the parts that its lubricating as well!</p>
   <p><strong>SIDEWALK DE-ICER</strong><br /> For icy steps and sidewalks
   in freezing temperatures, mix 1 teaspoon of Dawn dish washing liquid, 1
   tablespoon of rubbing alcohol, and 1/2 gallon hot/warm water and pour
   over walkways. They won&rsquo;t refreeze. No more salt eating at the
   concrete in your sidewalks</p> <p><strong>POOL CLEANING</strong><br />
   Squirt Dawn down the middle of the pool and all of the dirt, suntan
   lotion, etc. will move to the edges of the pool for easy clean up! AND
   it makes the pools sparkle.</p> <p><strong>EYEGLASS
   DEFOGGER</strong><br /> Simply rub a small drop of Dawn on eyeglass
   lenses, and wipe clean. It will leave a very thin film that will
   prevent them from fogging up.</p> <p><strong>SHOWER FLOORS</strong><br
   /> Cover greasy footprints on shower floors with a coating of Dawn; let
   sit overnight. Scrub away the gunk in the morning with a stiff
   brush.</p> <p><strong>APHID CONTROL ON FRUIT TREES</strong><br /> Mix
   two tablespoons Dawn to a gallon of water and put in your sprayer. Try
   to get spray both sides of the leaves, branches and the tree trunks.
   Let sit for about 15 minutes and then rinse the trees THOROUGHLY!</p>

   That Are Not For Baking.</strong> Of course aluminum foil has great
   uses for baking in your kitchen. But bet you never heard of these 12
   awesome uses:</p> <p><strong>Remove rust:</strong> All you have to do
   is soak the foil in water and scrub on rushed chrome. The rust will
   melt away.</p> <p><strong>Throw away grease:</strong> After you fry
   food. Pour your unwanted grease in a cup lined with aluminum foil. Wait
   until it hardens then throw it in the trash.</p> <p><img

   banana&rsquo;s fresher:</strong> Just wrap foil around the ends of a
   banana and it will keep them from getting brown too fast.</p>
   <p><strong>Burned pans:</strong> Use some dawn dish soap and a ball of
   aluminum foil and easily scrub it off.</p> <p><strong>Iron your
   clothes:</strong>&nbsp;Place a piece of tinfoil under the ironing board
   cover. This will reflect the iron&rsquo;s heat back up to the bottom of
   the clothes, allowing you to iron both sides at the same time.</p>
   <p><strong>Make a beautiful frame:</strong>&nbsp;Make a cheap wooden
   frame unique and beautiful! Simply paint the wooden frame with art
   glue, and adhere aluminum foil to the front of the frame. For best
   results, fold foil around the edges of the frame. It&rsquo;s OK if the
   foil is wrinkled &ndash; that adds to the rustic look! Once the glue
   dries, lightly sponge on metallic paint to create a rusted metal
   appearance.</p> <p><strong>Sharpen Scissors:</strong>&nbsp;Fold foil in
   quarters to create four layers. Then, cut foil with scissors &ndash; it
   will sharpen the blades.</p> <p><strong>Use as a funnel:</strong> Form
   a funnel out of foil. Easy clean up after, as you can simply throw out
   the dirty foil.</p> <p><strong>Use in your clothes
   dryer:</strong>&nbsp;By tossing a ball of wadded-up foil into the dryer
   with a load of clothes you can avoid static cling.</p> <p><strong>Keep
   your oven cleaner</strong>:&nbsp;Place a sheet of foil in the bottom
   rack to prevent any drips or crumbs falling to the bottom. Make sure to
   replace regularly to avoid any damage to the oven.</p> <p><strong>Move
   heavy furniture:</strong> Place aluminum foil under the legs of
   furniture and it will glide with ease.</p> <p><strong>Cover while
   painting.</strong> Cover door handles with foil and it will protect
   those areas from unwanted pain.</p> <p>&nbsp;</body></html></p> <div

   <li><strong>If booze in desserts is not your thing, skip
   it.</strong></li> <li><strong>Too short cut this recipe, you can use
   boxed pudding. I find boxed pudding to be overly sweet and&nbsp;keep in
   mind this recipe hasn&rsquo;t been tested&nbsp;with it so pour your
   alcohol slowly and mix along the way.</strong></li> <li><strong>If you
   want something slightly lighter in texture change out the pudding for
   mousse. I chose the pudding for its denser texture as I wanted the
   broken brownies and roasted almonds to be contrasted against something
   more full bodied like pudding versus the lighter-airy texture of
   &nbsp;mousse that would disappear too quickly in my mouth against those
   components.</strong></li> </ul> <h3><strong>Mudslide and Brownie
   Trifles</strong></h3> <p><strong>Serves 7-8 (in 6.5oz
   glasses)</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

   heartburn, toothache, arthritis pain, gas pain or nausea? Simple DIY
   remedies.</p> <p><strong>Earache</strong>:&nbsp;Whenever you suffer
   from an annoying and painful headache or earache,
   <strong>garlic</strong> can help relieve your misery. Just put a few
   drops of garlic oil on a cotton ball (or take a peeled clove of
   garlic), and gently place it in the opening of your ear.</p>
   <p><strong>Heartburn:</strong>&nbsp;Mix <strong>baking soda</strong>
   with water. You might have a&nbsp;heartburn&nbsp;remedy at hand in your
   kitchen without even knowing it. Baking soda can calm some episodes
   of&nbsp;heartburn&nbsp;by neutralizing your stomach acid.
   To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, dissolve a teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of
   water and drink it slowly. <strong>You can also read <a

   pain:</strong> Take a sniff of <strong>Lavender</strong>. Lavender can
   alter the perception of pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a pain-soothing
   aromatherapy treatment, add to a teaspoon to a quarter-cup of vegetable
   oil. Take a whiff frequently. Check out our <strong><a

   Therapy Hacks</a>.</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Toothache:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Salt water</strong> is a
   natural disinfectant, and it can help loosen food particles and debris
   that may be stuck in between your teeth. Treating a toothache
   with&nbsp;salt water&nbsp;can also help reduce inflammation and heal
   any oral wounds. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water
   and use it as a mouthwash. If your symptoms persist for more than a day
   or two, see your dentist.</p> <p><strong>Gas Pain</strong>:&nbsp;The
   easiest way to avoid these gas pain is to simply <strong>let out the
   gas</strong>. Don&rsquo;t drinking through a straw it can causes you to
   swallow air. Drinking directly from a bottle can have the same effect,
   depending on the bottle&rsquo;s size and shape. <strong>Avoid
   carbonated drinks</strong>, such as sparkling water and sodas, they
   send a lot of gas to the stomach. This can cause bloating and pain.</p>

   pour 1 cup of boiling water over it. Cover with a saucer and let sit

   will not bite you and most spiders are not poisonous. But most of us do
   not want them in our home. Here are a few natural ways to get rid of
   them.</p> <p>Fill a standard spray bottle with water and mix in 15 to
   20 drops of <strong>peppermint oil</strong>. Spray down all the cracks
   and corners of your house. They will run in the opposite direction.</p>
   <p>Mix equal parts <strong>white vinegar</strong> and water in a spray
   bottle. Apply it to any area in which spiders gather and spray it
   directly on any spider you see. Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is
   thought to burn and kill spiders upon contact.</p> <h4>Natural
   (Aggressive) Spider Repellent Spray Recipe</h4> <ul> <li>1 cup apple
   cider vinegar</li> <li>one teaspoon oil</li> <li>one cup pepper</li>
   <li>one teaspoon liquid dish soap.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Get a
   cat.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cats will chase anything that moves, making
   them natural spider repellents.</p> <p>Place <strong>Chestnuts</strong>
   along the baseboards in your home and along the window sills to prevent
   spiders from coming in.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Symptoms of a spider bite:</strong></p> <ol
   class="X5LH0c"> <li class="TrT0Xe">itching or rash.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">pain around the area of the bite.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">muscle pain or cramping.</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">blister
   that&rsquo;s red or purple in color.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">sweating.</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">difficulty
   breathing.</li> <li class="TrT0Xe">headache.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">nausea and vomiting.</li> </ol> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>What to do if you are bitten by a spider:</strong></p>
   <ul> <li>Clean the wound. Use mild soap and water and apply an
   antibiotic ointment.</li> <li>Apply a cool compress. Use a cloth
   dampened with cold water or filled with ice. This helps reduce pain and
   swelling. If the bite is on an arm or leg, elevate it.</li> <li>Take an
   over-the-counter pain medication if needed. If the wound is itchy, an
   antihistamine (Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, others) may help.</li> <li>Get
   immediate medical attention if you have severe pain, abdominal cramping
   or a growing ulcer at the bite site. Or the person who was bitten
   isn&rsquo;t breathing.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Check out this <a

   600px"></strong></p> <p><strong>12 Signs Of An Unhealthy
   Relationship</strong>. Good tips to know that you might be in an
   unhealthy relationship.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not referring to small arguments
   that resolve reasonably quickly with a compromise.</p> <p><strong>If
   you feel afraid of your partner:</strong>&nbsp; No one should feel
   afraid of the other person that they are close to. Fear is not only
   afraid of physical fear, but fear of falling apart, fear of
   abandonment, being hurt emotionally, loss of control of your
   relationship or chronic fear of insecurity.</p> <p><strong>Any Physical
   or VERBAL abuse:</strong> We all get into arguments from time to time.
   Sometimes we lose our cool and yell. It&rsquo;s all part of being
   human. But verbal abuse isn&rsquo;t normal, it can wear you down over
   time. Never accept physical or verbal abuse.&nbsp;When someone
   repeatedly uses words to demean, frighten, or control someone,
   it&rsquo;s considered verbal abuse.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re being verbally
   abused, know that it&rsquo;s not your fault. Continue reading to learn
   more, including how to recognize it and what you can do next.</p>
   <p><strong>Acting strange:</strong>&nbsp;When your partner acts
   differently with you versus how they act when you&rsquo;re not around.
   Examples can be lying to you, purposely leaving you out or not telling
   you things, being two-faced, acting differently around friends, or
   cheating while in a relationship with you.</p> <p><strong>They make
   excuses for their behavior</strong>. Examples can be blaming you, other
   people or past experiences for their actions, using alcohol or drugs as
   an excuse, using mental health issues or past experiences (like a
   cheating ex or divorced parents) as a reason for unhealthy
   behavior.</p> <p><strong>Too much pressure:</strong> Making you feel
   responsible for their happiness, making you feel like everything is
   your fault, threatening to hurt themselves or others if you don&rsquo;t
   do as they say or stay with them, pressuring you to do anything sexual
   you&rsquo;re not comfortable with. Telling you what to wear, who to
   talk to, what you can or can not do, or&nbsp;making you miss work,
   school or practice.</p> <p><strong>Making you feel bad about
   yourself.</strong>&nbsp;They can be calling you names, making rude
   remarks about who you hang out with, your family or what you look like,
   and making fun of you &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s played off as just a
   joke.</p> <p><strong>Keeping you away from friends, family, or other
   people:</strong>&nbsp;When your partner makes you choose between them
   and your friends, insisting you spend all your time with them, making
   you question your own judgement of friends and family, and making you
   feel dependent on them for money, love or acceptance.</p>
   <p><strong>Fighting or arguing too much:</strong> We all argue with our
   partner. But when you see that your are arguing more than normal then
   you might be in an unhealthy relationship. When the arguments get
   overwhelming and too intense.</p> <p><strong>Sending you mixed
   messages:</strong> One minute they say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and
   then later say &ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; Or do something trivially
   hateful to you and apologize later. Doing this more and more often.</p>
   <p><strong>Not attentive to your needs:</strong> Does not help you with
   the household chores, help take care of the children, or does not
   listen to you about how you are feeling.</p> <p><strong>Makes repeated
   threats to break up:</strong> When an argument gets too intense, just
   walk away. Take a break. If your partner is making threats to break up,
   take it seriously. It is usually a sign that they really mean it. It
   might be sooner or even later.</p> <p><strong>You find you are doing
   more things apart than you are doing together.</strong>&nbsp;Remember
   when you use to go to the movies together? Try to get your partner to
   be the same person you met. Go places together, play games together.
   Sit down and have a talk, talk about things that happened today, what
   you did, what the children did or anything you are feeling.</p>
   <p><strong>Trust your instincts. Don&rsquo;t live in a relationship
   that is full of fear. There is a life after breaking
   up.&nbsp;</strong></body></html></p> <div class='code-block

   center;"><strong>Want your home to smell good? </strong></p> <p>Grab
   some lemon, vanilla extract, and rosemary. Throw them in your crock
   pot. Add a little water, then turn it on low. Your home will smell
   fantastic, but not overpowering.</p> <p>Place vanilla scented tea light
   in bowl of coffee beans. The warmth of the candles will heat up the
   coffee bean and make your home smell like french vanilla coffee.</p>
   <p>Spices and savory candles scents match well in the kitchen, like
   cinnamon, clove, or cardamom.</p> <p>Make your house smell like spring.
   Take 2 lemons (sliced), 3 to 4 sprigs of thyme, 1/2 teaspoon mint
   extract, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Fill a pot on your stove with
   water and simmer.</p> <p>Use lemon-Scented Pledge. It can be used on
   wood and stainless steel, so try wiping down your furniture and
   appliances with this product before visitors arrive. Makes your home
   smell so delicious.</p> <p>Placing fresh flowers around your home will
   give the whole house a fresh smell.</p> <p>Make your won aroma
   beads.<strong> Instructions <a
   href="http://www.bittercreeksouth.com/aroma_beads_instructions.htm"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE&nbsp;</a></strong></p> <p>Cooking
   cabbage and stinking up the house? Add a bay leaf. This will reduce the
   smell during cooking and give it a subtle flavor.</p> <p>Run half a
   lemon through the garbage disposal once a week. It lubricates the
   blades while giving the sink and kitchen a fresh, lemony scent.</p>
   <p>Fresh-baked cookies or BREAD makes your home smell warm and
   inviting. So cook away before guest arrive.</p> <p>To create a homey
   atmosphere, put some cinnamon spice in a pot with water and boil.
   Or&nbsp;cinnamon and orange peels simmering on the stove!</p> <p>Use
   cinnamon or vanilla beans in a pot of simmering water or a small crock
   pot. The scent lasts as long as the water does, so make sure you keep
   adding a little water every few hours. And they are not as overpowering
   as some of the candles people burn. When the scent is too strong,turn
   it off.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Want to relax?
   </strong></p> <p>Citrus scents, especially orange essential oil, will
   help you relax. Just rub a few drops on the palm of your hand and take
   a deep breath. Stress be gone!</p> <p>Use aroma therapy with your bath.
   Add coconut and rose water to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes. Not
   only will it help you relax but will make your skin feel softer and
   smell luscious.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Want to
   sleep better at night? </strong></p> <p>Place a few drops of lavender
   oil on a tissue and place it inside your pillow case before going to
   bed. You will drift off to sleep with sweet dreams!</p> <p>Use calming,
   sleep inducing scents in the bedroom. Use a vanilla candle. Other
   recommendations for a bedroom include eucalyptus mint scented candle,
   lavender, jasmine, sandalwood or chamomile.</body></html></p> <div

   sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><strong>What Your Tongue Might
   Be Telling You About Your Health.</strong> Let&rsquo;s take a look at
   what your tongue is telling you.</p> <p><strong>A&nbsp;healthy
   tongue</strong>&nbsp;should be pink and covered with small nodules
   (papillae). Any deviation from your&nbsp;tongue&rsquo;s
   normal&nbsp;appearance, or any pain, may be cause for concern.
   A&nbsp;number of diseases can show up on your tongue.</p>
   <p><strong>Bright Red Tongue:</strong></p> <p>Could mean you have a
   vitamin deficiency. A glossy, bright red tongue may be a sign your body
   is lacking iron or B12.</p> <p><strong>Brown or Black
   Tongue:</strong></p> <p>Could mean you don&rsquo;t have the best oral
   hygiene or tongue health. May look nasty but not really a health
   concern. But can cause bad breath or taste abnormalities. Removing the
   offending cause, like smoking, and brushing the tongue or using a
   tongue scraper, may be all you need.</p> <p><strong>Lumpy White Coated
   Tongue:</strong></p> <p>Could mean you have a yeast infection. Also
   called&nbsp;Thrush, which might cause taste disturbances or a bit of
   pain, can also occur in those with weakened immune systems. Usually
   happens after taking an antibiotic.&nbsp;A salt water rinse to help
   ease the symptoms of the yeast infection and clean out the
   mouth.&nbsp;If you suspect you might have thrush, see your doctor.</p>
   <p><strong>Wrinkles On Your Tongue:</strong></p> <p>As we get older we
   many get wrinkles in our tongue, which is natural.&nbsp;Fissures and
   cracks in the tongue are typically harmless, but problems can arise if
   poor dental hygiene leads to infection within the crevices.</p>
   <p><strong>Small White Patches:</strong></p> <p>It may mean something
   is irritating your mouth. If they don&rsquo;t go away in a week or two,
   it&rsquo;s extremely important to see your dentist, who might recommend
   a biopsy.</p> <p><strong>Burning Sensation:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>It
   may mean you are in&nbsp;postmenopausal, or using the wrong toothpaste.
   Try toothpaste like Sensodyne.</p> <p><strong>Painful
   Sores:</strong></p> <p>May mean your are stressed. Also called canker
   sores usually subside and eventually disappear within two
   weeks.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re not contagious. Just make sure it&rsquo;s not
   a <strong>cold sore</strong>, which is an extremely contagious sore
   (caused by the herpes simplex virus) that typically appears on the
   lips.&nbsp;Canker sores&nbsp;appear on the soft tissues inside the
   mouth, while a&nbsp;cold sore&nbsp;usually shows up on the outside of
   the mouth. A&nbsp;canker sore&nbsp;is an ulcer and a&nbsp;cold
   sore&nbsp;is a blister.</p> <p><strong>Red Lesions&nbsp; or
   patches.</strong><br /> It could mean you have tongue cancer. Be sure
   to read:&nbsp; <a
   href="https://www.rd.com/health/conditions/oral-cancer-symptoms/1/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 Silent Signs of Oral Cancer You
   Shouldn&rsquo;t Ignore</a></p> <p>Always check with your doctor or
   dentist if you have problems with your tongue. While most problems can
   be solved over time some can mean very severe
   problems.</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   600px"><strong>How To Treat Brain Fog. </strong></p> <p>Do you have
   brain fog? Tips to treat your brain fog.</p> <p>Brain fog is not a
   medical condition. It is a symptom of other possible medical
   conditions. You may have memory problems, difficulty concentrating,
   mental confusion or unable to focus on the task at hand.</p> <p
   style="text-align: center;"><strong>Some of the causes might
   be:</strong></p> <p><strong>Menopause</strong></p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Treatment:&nbsp;Hormone supplements and
   other types of medication may help.</p>
   <p><strong>Depression</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Treatment:&nbsp;Treatment for your depression, which includes
   medication and talk therapy, should help get you back on
   track.&nbsp;Trying something new alters the levels of dopamine, which
   is associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and learning.&nbsp;Plan things
   you used to enjoy, even if they feel like a chore.</p> <p><strong>Lack
   of sleep </strong></p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Treatment:&nbsp;Sleep 7 to 9 hours a night.&nbsp;Try
   repeatedly tensing and releasing your toes to the count of 10. Avoid
   caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. Have a night time snack before
   going to bed. Cheese, omega-3-rich fish like tuna, sardines, or
   mackerel can get the job done, too. Or low fat milk, whole grain
   crackers, bananas and cherries.</p> <p><strong>Stress</strong></p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Treatment: Know your limitations of your
   stress level. Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine.&nbsp; Natural
   remedies include passionflower, massage, mediation, exercise and B
   vitamins.</p> <p><strong>Hormonal changes</strong></p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Treatment: Blood test. Most hormones can be
   detected in the blood. A doctor can use a blood test to check your
   thyroid, estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol levels then possibly
   prescribe medications such as low dose estrogen therapy.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Your diet</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Treatment:&nbsp; increasing your intake of protein, fruits,
   vegetables, and healthy fats.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Foods that may cause your brain fog:</strong></p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Processed Meat.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Dairy. Many people are sensitive to dairy products like milk,
   cheese, and yogurt.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">MSG.</p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Alcohol.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Artificial Sweeteners.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;"><strong>Foods that may help:</strong></p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Nutritional Yeast.</p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Turmeric.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Spinach.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">Avocado.</p> <p
   style="text-align: center;">Eggs.</p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Celery.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">Rosemary.</p>
   <p><strong>Medications you take</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
   center;">Treatment: Some kinds of drugs ,over-the-counter and
   prescribed, can cause brain fog. If you take medicine and notice that
   your thinking isn&rsquo;t as clear as it should be or you suddenly
   can&rsquo;t remember things, call your doctor. Be sure to let him know
   all the medications you take.</p> <p><strong>Medical
   conditions</strong> associated with inflammation, fatigue, or changes
   in blood glucose level can also cause brain fog. This can include:
   chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia and depression.&nbsp;You should let
   your doctor know about other symptoms you might have.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

   600px"></strong></p> <p><strong>What Your Snot Can Tell You</strong>.
   Ever wonder what the color of your snot means. It can tell you a lot of
   things.</p> <p>Snot is mucus from your nose.&nbsp;Typically, mucus is
   clear and thin and not noticeable at all. When someone gets sick with a
   cold or an infection, the mucus can become thickened and changes
   color.</p> <p><strong>Clear snot</strong> is normal. It consists of
   water, salts, antibodies and other immune system cells. After being
   produced in the respiratory tract, most of it goes down the back of the
   throat and is swallowed.&nbsp;Thin and watery snot is usually normal
   and indicates a healthy respiratory tract.</p> <p><strong>Brown
   snot</strong> may indicate possible bleeding, and if so, is likely to
   be caused by bleeding that happened a while ago. Bright red or pink
   phlegm means the bleeding has happened more recently.</p>
   <p><strong>Black snot</strong> may indicate the presence of a fungal
   infection. Someone who has black snot should contact their doctor
   immediately, especially if they have a weakened immune system.</p>
   <p><strong>White snot</strong> signals nasal congestion. When the nasal
   cavity is congested, the tissues are swollen and inflamed, which slows
   the passage of mucus through the respiratory tract. When this happens,
   the snot becomes thicker and cloudy or white.</p> <p><strong>Yellow
   snot</strong> suggests that immune cells are starting to work at the
   site of the infection or another type of inflammatory insult.&nbsp;You
   might have heard that&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;or green snot&nbsp;is a clear
   sign that you have an infection, but despite that common misconception,
   the&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;or green hue isn&rsquo;t due to bacteria. When you
   have a cold, your immune system sends white blood cells called
   neutrophils rushing to the area. So that can be a good sign.</p>
   <p><strong>Thick Green snot</strong>&nbsp;can point to an
   infection,&nbsp;antibiotics&nbsp;are&nbsp;not always needed. Most
   infections that lead to green phlegm are viral and usually resolve
   without treatment within a few weeks.&nbsp;A <strong>thick</strong>
   and&nbsp;dark yellow snot&nbsp;may be a sign of a viral or bacterial
   infection, sinus infection, or lower respiratory tract infection.</p>
   <p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;<b>sinus infection</b>&nbsp;may be
   accompanied by other symptoms like:</p> <ul>
   <li>post-nasal&nbsp;drip,</li> <li>green (or
   yellow)&nbsp;nasal&nbsp;discharge,</li> <li>aching in your teeth,</li>
   <li>fever,</li> <li>bad breath,</li> <li>sinus pressure or a headache
   that worsens&nbsp;when you&nbsp;lean forward or lie down.</li> </ul> <p
   data-spx-slot="1"><strong>Pink and frothy snot</strong> can mean that
   someone is experiencing severe left-sided&nbsp;heart failure,
   especially when combined with any of the following symptoms:</p> <ul>
   <li>shortness of breath</li> <li>sweating</li> <li>chest pain</li>
   </ul> <p>Anyone experiencing these symptoms should head to their local
   emergency room immediately.</p> <p>&nbsp;</body></html></p> <div

   potatoes:</strong><br /> The humble sweet potato is packed with
   nutrition; is simple to bake in an oven, microwave, or cook on a grill;
   and can be seasoned with a variety of your favorite toppings as well as
   paired with other vegetables.</p> <p>Step 1: Select potatoes<br />
   Select fresh, firm, smooth, and plump sweet potatoes and wash them as
   you would other vegetables.</p> <p>Tip<br /> Cook sweet potatoes whole
   to benefit from nutrients found next to the skin.</p> <p>Step 2:
   Pierce<br /> Pierce your dry sweet potatoes a few times with a fork
   before baking or microwaving.</p> <p>Step 3: Place on pan and bake<br
   /> Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed pan and bake at 375 degrees for
   about 45 minutes or until they are tender.</p> <p>Step 4: Quick-cook<br
   /> Quick-cook sweet potatoes by placing two clean, pierced potatoes in
   a microwave oven for five to nine minutes, or four sweet potatoes for
   10 to 13 minutes.</p> <p>Tip<br /> Sweet potatoes rank high among the
   healthiest of vegetables, providing vitamins A and C, potassium, and
   fiber.</p> <p>Step 5: Grill<br /> Grill sweet potatoes by first boiling
   them, letting them cool, and then slicing them lengthwise into eighths,
   oiling the slices, and grilling all sides until they&rsquo;re golden
   brown.</p> <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLlLnAZKl8Q"

   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients"> <ul> <li>Cake: 1 cup butter
   softened (2 cups sugar, 4 large eggs, 3 cups self-rising flour, 1 cup
   whole buttermilk, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Caramel Frosting: 2
   cups sugar, 1/4 cup water, 2 Tablespoons light corn syrup, 1/2 cup cold
   butter- cubed, 1 cup hot heavy whipping cream (see note), 1 cup butter
   -softened, 6 cups confectioners sugar- sifted Garnish: toasted pecan
   halves)</li> </ul> </div> <div
   class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions"> <ol>
   <li><strong>Cake:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 3 (9
   inch) round pans with nonstick cooking spray with flour. Line bottoms
   of pans with parchment paper; lightly spray again. In a large bowl,
   beat butter and sugar at medium speed with a mixer until fluffy,
   stopping occasionally to scrap sites of bowl. Add eggs, one at a time,
   beating well after each addition. Add flour to butter mixture in
   thirds, alternating with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour
   mixture. Stir in vanilla. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans,
   smoothing tops with a spatula. Bake until a wooden pick inserted into
   center of layers comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Let layers cool in
   pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans, discard parchment paper, and let
   cool completely on wire racks. Spread caramel frosting between layers
   and on top and sides of cake. Drizzle with reserved 1/3 cup of caramel
   from caramel frosting. Garnish with pecans, if desired.</li>
   <li><strong>Caramel Frosting:</strong> In a large heavy bottomed
   saucepan, place sugar. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup water
   and corn syrup. Pour over sugar, stirring just until sugar is
   moistened. Cook, without stirring, over medium high heat until mixture
   is golden brown. (While caramel cooks, brush any sugar crystals on side
   of pan with a pastry brush dipped in water.) Remove from heat. Using a
   long handed wooden spoon, add cold butter. Stir until butter melts.
   (Mixture will foam.) Slowly add hot cream, stirring until smooth. (If
   mixture does not get smooth, cook over low heat, stirring until
   smooth.) Set aside, and let mixture cool until slightly warm,
   approximately 1 hour, stirring occasional. Reserve 1/3 cup caramel to
   drizzle over assembled cake. Pour caramel mixture into a large bowl;
   add softened butter. Beat at medium speed with a mixture until smooth.
   With mixer on low, gradually add confectioners sugar, beating just
   until smooth. Place piece of plastic wrap on surface of frosting. Let
   stand until frosting has reached a spreadable consistency, about 10
   minutes.</li> <li><strong>Note:</strong>To keep caramelized sugar from
   hardening or seizing in step 2 of Caramel Frosting, microwave heavy
   cream until it&rsquo;s hot but not boiling, 60 to 90 seconds, before
   you add it to the caramel.</li> </ol> </div> <div

   Wax.</strong></p> <p>With the help of a Q-tip, you can check the color
   of your ear wax and understand what it means.</p> <p>Ear wax is not a
   body waste to get rid of regularly, quite the contrary &ndash;
   it&rsquo;s a kind of protection.</p> <p>It keeps the ear canal
   lubricated, therefore, prevents the ears from itching. Moreover, it
   prevents different pollutants from entering the inner ear.</p> <p>Even
   more surprisingly, this substance has antibacterial properties. Our
   body is a clever mechanism. Did you know that when we chew, the
   movement pushes ear wax to the outer part of the ear? This way, your
   ears self-clean!</p> <p>If your ears tend to produce a big amount of
   ear wax creating a build-up, you can take some preventive measures
   yourself. &ndash; It&rsquo;s effective to use agents softening the wax.
   They can be mineral or baby oil, or ear drops. It is enough to put a
   few drops of these substances into your ear once a week to soften the
   ear wax and help it to come out faster and with ease.</p> <p>Salt water
   is one of the best ear wax removal solution that can be used at home.
   It softens the wax accumulated inside the ear making it&nbsp;easy to
   clean. Mix a teaspoon of salt in half a cup of warm water until
   the&nbsp;salt&nbsp;gets completely dissolved. Soak a cotton ball in the
   solution. Tilt the affected ear upwards towards the sky. Squeeze the
   cotton ball to put a few drops of the saline water into the ear and
   stay in the same position for three to five minutes. Next, tilt your
   head in the opposite direction to allow the saline water to drain out.
   Clean the outer part of your ear with a clean cloth to remove the
   softened wax.</p> <p><strong>Q-tips aren&rsquo;t for cleaning your
   ear&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Another way to take care of your
   ears is to buy a special at-home kit for their irrigation. Follow the
   instruction precisely step by step.</p> <p>Watch video for the 8 ear
   wax tips as to what your ear wax might mean:</p> <p><iframe

   <p><strong>Can I freeze corn on the cob whole, or should I scrape the
   corn off of the cob before I freeze it?</strong></p> <p>On the Cob
   works great. I put some in the freezer a few days ago.</p> <p>Just cut
   the kernels off the cob as close to the cob as you can without getting
   any of the cob with it. You will get the feel of it once you get
   going.</p> <p>Freeze it whole uncooked wrapped in news paper when
   thawed just boil as usual. Delish!</p> <p>You can freeze it&nbsp;with
   the innermost layer of the husk still on it. Always turns out
   great.</p> <p>Don&rsquo;t wash it. Just shuck it, brush off the silks,
   and put it in freezer bags, get all the air you can out of the bags
   before zipping them.</p> <p>Both ways. My mom scraped so it
   didn&rsquo;t take up as much room.</p> <p>As you can see, either way is
   ok!!!</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li> <li>Butter three 9-inch cake

   Frosting:</h4> <ol> <li>In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream
   cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best
   results</li> <li>Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until
   combined.</li> <li>Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as
   necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very
   thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.</li> </ol> </div>

   snacks:</strong></p> <p>Airlines often have a good supply of snacks.
   After snacks have been given out and you are still hungry just ask your
   fight attendant if they have any extra. On the most basic level, you
   can ask for unlimited refills and snacks from the refreshment cart, but
   if you have a reason (like a delayed flight or faulty seat), ask for a
   comped glass of wine or a cocktail. Most will gladly oblige.</p>

   600px"><strong>10 Reasons To Use An Air Fryer.</strong> I have an air
   fryer and use it daily. So convenient and easy to use. I have lots of
   recipes for my air fryer.</p> <p>An air fryer has mechanical fan
   circulates the hot&nbsp;air&nbsp;around the food at high speed, cooking
   the food and producing a crispy layer.&nbsp; Counter-top&nbsp;air
   fryers&nbsp;are a healthy alternative to the traditional way of frying
   food in a pot of oil.</p> <p><strong>Healthier than frying</strong>.
   You can cook all sorts of things in an air fryer. Using less than a
   tablespoon of oil or a couple of spray of canola cooking spray, you can
   fry beef, chicken, fish, frozen food and vegetables. A&nbsp;healthier
   way with up to 75% less fat.</p> <p><strong>Cooking frozen
   food</strong> in the air fryer is very efficient and they are super
   crispy and taste delicious. Pop in your favorite potato delights in the
   baskets and you will have crispy fries in a fraction of the time and in
   a much healthier style.</p> <p>It makes <strong>cleaning up a
   breeze</strong>. Just cook and wipe out the inside after most
   cooking.</p> <p>Be sure to clean your air fryer weekly or regularly,
   depending on how often you use it. But give it a good cleaning once a
   week.</p> <ul> <li>Take out the tray and pans and rinse out the
   leftover oils and food.</li> <li>Soak them in warm soapy water for an
   hour.</li> <li>Scrub them with a gentle cleansing brush. Rinse and dry
   with a kitchen towel.</li> <li>Or place trays and the pan in the
   dishwasher.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The air fryer is quiet</strong>. It
   is powerful, but doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of fuss.</p> <p>It also
   <strong>saves tons of cooking time</strong>. Most food will cooking in
   less than 1/2 the time of a regular oven.</p> <p>Your<strong> kitchen
   does not get hot</strong> as with a regular oven.</p> <p>Compared to
   deep-frying, using an&nbsp;<strong>air fryer&nbsp;can reduce the amount
   of fa</strong>t, calories and potentially harmful compounds in your
   food.</p> <p><strong>Air fryers are actually more gentle and suitable
   for baked goods</strong>.&nbsp;The heat generated from it is pulled up
   with the fan, so there is no direct heat source on the food. It&rsquo;s
   dispersed on the outside of the chamber, and then ascends from the open
   bottom to heat the baked goods from all around.</p> <p>Air fryers are
   <strong>smaller than convection ovens</strong>. Which makes them
   efficient for daily family meals.</p> <p>An air fryer&nbsp;spares you
   from that <strong>unwanted aroma</strong> of&nbsp;fried&nbsp;foods in
   your home.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Check out our <a

   Day No Spending Challenge.</strong> A DIY project to save money. You
   will be surprised how much money you can save in 30 days.</p>
   <p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a peak at your checking account.
   </strong></p> <p>Pick one <strong>non- essential thing</strong> where
   you spend your money. Non- essential expenses are not essential to meet
   your needs.&nbsp;You may want these things because you like or enjoy
   them but they are not necessary for your survival.</p> <p>It might be
   for entertainment or eating out.</p> <p>Maybe you could cancel
   your&nbsp;memberships, and magazine subscriptions.</p> <p>Drive your
   car less.&nbsp;Consider using public transportation, walking or riding
   a bike to and from work.</p> <p>Raise the deductible on your insurance
   policies to lower your monthly premiums. Be prepared to pay the
   deductible though, if an emergency does happen.</p> <p>Skip restaurant
   lunches and pack your lunch&mdash;every day.</p> <p>Use netflix instead
   of going to the movies.</p> <p>Make your morning coffee instead of
   buying.</p> <p>Do not use your credit card for one month. Pay with
   cash.</p> <p>Cut down on your electric bill. In the summer, close
   blinds, use fans and turn air conditioner down while you are not
   home.</p> <p><strong>Use the 30 day rule</strong>. It is a simple
   method to control impulse spending. Here&rsquo;s how it works: Whenever
   you feel the urge to splurge &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s for new shoes,
   a new video game, or a new car &mdash; force yourself to stop. If
   you&rsquo;re already holding the item, put it back and leave the
   store.&nbsp; For the next thirty days, think whether you really want
   the item, but do not buy it.&nbsp; If, at the end of a month, the urge
   is still there, then consider purchasing it. (But&nbsp;<i>do not use
   credit to do so</i>.)</p> <p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;Pick a
   goal.</strong></p> <p>Pick a goal that is right for you and your
   family.</p> <p>You may want to take a vacation at the end of the
   year.</p> <p>You may want to pay off your credit cards.</p> <p>You may
   want to build up your saving account. Money for your children&rsquo;s
   college.</p> <p>Save money for a down payment on a house.</p> <p>Money
   for retirement.</p> <p><strong>Think of your goal every time you save
   money.</strong> This will help you meet your goal.</p> <p><strong>Step
   3:</strong></p> <p>Remember no spending does not mean NO fun. Pick
   things that you feel are non-essential for you.</body></html></p> <div

   <p>Chiggers are a&nbsp;juvenile forms of a mite. Chiggers are only
   barely visible to the naked eye. Juvenile forms are red in color and
   have 6 legs.&nbsp;Adult chiggers don&rsquo;t bite. It&rsquo;s the
   babies, called larvae, that you have to watch out for. They&rsquo;re
   red, orange, yellow, or straw-colored, and no more than 0.3 millimeters
   long.</p> <p>They&nbsp;live in all parts of the world. They are most
   commonly found in:</p> <ul> <li>forests,</li> <li>grassy fields,</li>
   <li>parks, gardens, and</li> <li>in moist areas around lakes or
   rivers.</li> <li><strong>Symptoms</strong> of chigger bites include
   intense itching, and flat or raised red&nbsp;bumps&nbsp;on the skin.
   They sometimes have an appearance of a blister.</li> </ul> <p>The only
   effective treatments are anti-itch creams and medications, such as
   Benadryl.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;calamine&nbsp;lotion and corticosteroid
   creams may be useful in reducing the itching of chigger bites. Home
   remedies to relieve itching, such as cool showers or baths, colloidal
   oatmeal baths, or cool compresses may bring some relief.</p>
   <p><strong>Home Remedies:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Take a
   <strong>Dobie pad</strong> ( for washing dishes) and scrub in the
   shower. It will get seed ticks, chiggers, and exfoliate your skin at
   the same time. When you get out, use baby oil or a itch cream.</p>
   <p><strong>2</strong>. Apply <strong>clear nail polish</strong> to the
   area.</p> <p><strong>3. Vicks vaporub</strong> may stop the itching
   itching.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> This is an old recipe for chiggers
   on your body. Put a small amount of <strong>salt</strong> in the palm
   of your hand. Add a drop or two of water to make a paste, rub it on the
   chigger bite. In just a little while you will see a red dot appear.
   That&rsquo;s the chigger. If all over your body, set in a tub of
   <strong>epsom salt</strong> water.</p> <p><strong>5. Baking
   soda</strong> add water and enough to make a paste and rub it on
   it.</p> <p><strong>6. Alcohol</strong> on cotton balls. Wipe the area.
   It also get rid of the remaining chiggers.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong>
   Put an <strong>ice pack</strong> on the place where you have been
   bitten for a quick relief from itching. You can also put a topical
   cream, like Neosprin.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> In order to reduce the
   excessive itchiness, wrap the area with an <strong>ace
   bandage</strong>. This will interrupt the air supply and reduce
   itching.</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> After washing the affected area
   with soap and water, soak a cotton ball in some <strong>Listerine
   mouthwash</strong> and apply it to the chigger rash.</p>
   <p><strong>10.</strong> Massage some <strong>castor oil</strong> on the
   affected skin to get relief from the itchiness and
   irritation</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   Carpet</strong>.</p> <p>DIY tips for removing a stinky carpet smell and
   stains:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Your&nbsp;carpet&nbsp;is one of
   the key smell-trappers of your home. But there&rsquo;s an even easier
   way to eliminate&nbsp;carpet&nbsp;odors,&nbsp;using<b>
   Febreze</b>&nbsp;<strong>Fabric Refresher</strong>! Application
   couldn&rsquo;t be easier; just spray&nbsp;Febreze&nbsp;all over until
   it&rsquo;s damp! Let it dry and the uninvited smells are gone.</p>
   <p><strong>2.</strong> 50/50 <strong>vinegar/baking soda
   mixture</strong>, let sit, wipe, dry &amp; vacuum.</p> <p><strong>3.
   Detergent solution:</strong> Mix 1/4 teaspoon of a translucent liquid
   dish washing detergent, such as Dawn or Joy, into one cup of lukewarm
   water.&nbsp;Dip a white cloth into these solutions and apply to the
   stain. Never pour the solutions directly onto carpeting.</p>
   <p><strong>4.</strong> Sprinkle <strong>baking soda</strong> over your
   carpet! Let it set for about 20 minutes and then vacuum up. It works
   great and it&rsquo;s a very cheap way to refresh your carpet.</p>
   <p><strong>5. DRY coffee grounds</strong> work wonders. Sprinkle them
   on let them sit, vacuum them up. Use them on anything and everything
   that needs odor removed. Or for a stinky drawer put a tablespoon fresh
   coffee grounds in a coffee filter rubber banded and throw in each
   drawer and will suck the smell right out.</p> <p><strong>6. Steam
   clean</strong> with a bit of <strong>bleach</strong> in with the
   cleaning solution. It works great.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Spray
   lots of <strong>straight white vinegar</strong> on it! I use it all the
   time on almost everything. Smell goes away!</p> <p><strong>8. Baking
   soda and borax</strong>:&nbsp;The ingredients that you will need to
   make the deodorizer include half a cup of baking soda, half a cup of
   borax and one teaspoon of ground spices. <strong>Cinnamon</strong> is a
   great option to try in this recipe. Mix these ingredients well and
   store in a dry, well-ventilated place. Sprinkle the mix on a carpet
   that smells bad and leave it on for at least 30 minutes. Vacuum clean
   and you should be left solely with the enticing scent of the ground
   spices.</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   Healthy</strong>.</p> <p>A better way to clean your teeth. A lot
   cheaper, easier and less messy than an expensive WaterPik. You can buy
   them a Walmart or any drug store.</p> <p><strong>Ways to clean your
   teeth:</strong></p> <p><strong>First you need to brush your
   teeth</strong></p> <ul> <li>Place your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle
   to the gums.</li> <li>Gently move the brush back and forth in short
   (tooth-wide) strokes.</li> <li>Brush the outer surfaces, the inner
   surfaces, and the chewing surfaces of the teeth.</li> <li>To clean the
   inside surfaces of the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make
   several up-and-down strokes. Watch video <strong><a
   href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/b/brushing-your-teeth"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a></strong></li> </ul>
   <p><strong>Then floss your teeth</strong>: Watch video<strong><a
   href="https://myhoneysplace.com/proper-way-to-floss-your-teeth-video/">
   Here</a></strong></p> <p><strong>The Secret</strong>: Instead of buying
   an expensive waterpik you can use a syringe. Like the one pictured
   above. Not messy like a waterpik.</p> <ul> <li>Fill the syringe with
   warm water.</li> <li>Place the tip at the <strong>gum line</strong> of
   each tooth. Cup your mouth tightly around the tip of the syringe and
   push a small amount of the water from the syringe. Pull out the syringe
   from your mouth then you can then swallow the warm water without
   opening your mouth.&nbsp; Repeat this process between each tooth.</li>

   they were young.&nbsp; Works fantastic.</p> <p><strong>Apply Vapor Rub
   to the bottom of you or your child&rsquo;s feet and put on socks. Works
   100% of the time and has proven to be more effective than prescription
   drugs.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>More
   uses for Vapor Rub:</strong></p> <p><b>Decongestant For Your
   Chest&nbsp;</b><br /> The most common use of Vapo rub is a decongestant
   for your chest and throat area. When applied to the upper chest, it
   provides excellent relief of cough and congestion symptoms.</p>
   <p><b>&nbsp;Achy Muscles</b><br /> Vapo Rub relieves sore, overworked
   muscles. It increases circulation and provides almost instant aid. Use
   a generous portion and apply it all over the aching area.</p>
   <p><strong>Sinuses&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Put in boiling water for
   sinuses. Boil for about 30 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Prevent
   Infection</strong></p> <p>To prevent infection and speed up healing
   time, dab a small amount of Vapo Rub on any small cut or splinter.</p>
   <p><strong>Keep Insects away</strong></p> <p>Rub VapoRub on your neck,
   behind your ears, inner knees and elbows. Insects be gone! You could
   also open a jar and place it on your picnic table to keep bugs
   away.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;Nail Fungus</b><br /> Rub VapoRub on your
   toenails if you suspect you have a fungus. Within days, the nail will
   turn dark&mdash;this means the Vicks is killing the fungus. As your
   toenail grows out, the dark part will grow off and you will have
   fungus-free feet. Keep applying the ointment over a period of two weeks
   to fully cleanse nail beds of any remaining bacteria.</p> <p><b>Stop
   Your Cat from Scratching&nbsp;</b><br /> Cats are notorious for
   scratching every hard surface they get their claws on. To prevent your
   kitty from ruining your doors, walls, and windows, apply a small amount
   of VapoRub to these areas. Cats detest the smell and will steer clear.
   Vicks can also be applied to your arms and legs if your kitty is prone
   to scratching you.</p> <p><strong>Treat cracked heels</strong></p>
   <p>Apply to heels and cover with socks at bedtime. The next morning
   wash your feet with warm water. Exfoliate the skin with a pumice stone.
   This will keep your feet healthy and smooth.</p>
   <p><b>Headaches&nbsp;</b><br /> Rub a small amount of VapoRub on your
   temples and forehead to help relieve headaches. The mentholated scent
   will release pressure in your head and instantly relieve
   pain.</body></html></p> <div class='code-block code-block-2'

   to be made. Here are some ideal tips to make it a much smoother
   ride.</p> <p><strong>How to get down stairs if your elevator is not
   working.</strong> A lot of the elderly live in apartments. If the
   elevators are not working or in case of a fire and you can not use your
   elevator getting down the steps could be very difficult. If you are
   unable to walk down the stairs, then sit down on the first step. Place
   your feet firmly on the second or third step, and scoot yourself
   down.</p> <p><strong>How to get up from the floor or ground without
   help:</strong></p> <p><iframe

   data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px;
   overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"
   class="mce_SELRES_start">&#65279;</span></iframe></p> <p><strong>If you
   fall in your home and unable to get up</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>If you
   feel you are not injured, most cites have emergency personal that will
   assist you. You can dial 311. This is a free service.</li> <li>You
   could also purchase a Medical Alert System. They are reasonably priced.
   My Mother had one and used it many times. Most state Medicaid plans
   will furnish one for the elderly. These can be a lifesaver.</li> <li>If
   you do not have a medical alert system, keep your mobile phone with at
   all time. Have speed dial set up so only one button needs to be
   pushed.</li> <li>If really strapped for money then purchase a
   &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; phone with very little time on the phone and
   use it for emergency only.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How to get in and out
   of a car</strong>.</p> <p><iframe

   500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"><br /> Purchase a non
   slip rubber jar opener. I bought one at the 99 cent store and it sure
   comes in handy to open jars.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Put
   most used items at waist level in your kitchen and bedroom dresser
   drawers.</p> <p>Use a 10 point mirror to apply makeup or just to check
   for face cleanness.</p> <p>If you are hard of hearing ask people to
   talk to you by talking slowly, clearly and facing you. Politely ask the
   person<strong> NOT</strong> to shout. Shouting does not help.</p>
   <p>When you bathe use a 2 in one shampoo. It will take less time.</p>
   <p>For minor muscle aches and pains I use &ldquo;Zim&rsquo;s Max
   Freeze&rdquo;. It is an OTC ointment that is 100 per-cent natural
   menthol. Works very well and is inexpensive.</p> <p>Use a microwave or
   crock pot for most of your cooking.</p> <p>Buy reading glasses at the
   99 cent store. Will save you money and work just as well as expensive
   ones.</p> <p>If you sleep in a bedroom and your family is in another
   bedroom, place a bell or whistle beside your bed. Your family is more
   likely to hear you if you need them.</p> <p>Use a weekly pill box for
   your medications. You are more likely to remember if you took them or
   not.</p> <p>If you need a walker to ambulate, then USE it.</p>
   <p><strong>To help prevent falls in the home:&nbsp;</strong></p> <ul>
   <li>Clean up clutter around the areas you walk.</li> <li>Install grab
   bars and handrails. In the shower and beside steps.</li> <li>Avoid
   wearing loose clothing that can cause you to trip over baggy
   pants.</li> <li>Install brighter light bulbs where needed, particularly
   in stairways and narrow hallways.</li> <li>Wear shoes or non-slip
   socks.</li> <li>Put non-slip mats in your shower.</li> <li>Pause after
   going from lying down to sitting and from sitting to standing.</li>
   <li>Do not use area rugs in your home. They are too easy to trip
   over.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</body></html></p> <div class='code-block

   gives you warning signs early on so that you can catch an illness in
   its early stages or even prevent it altogether and save your life. Here
   are 10 of the most common red flags that indicate bad heart health:</p>
   <p><strong>A cough that won&rsquo;t quit.</strong> A persistent cough
   can be a symptom of all kinds of health issues, and cardiovascular
   disease is one of them. For instance, a chronic cough that produces a
   pinkish bloody liquid is very common in people with heart failure.
   Despite what it sounds like, heart failure doesn&rsquo;t mean that the
   heart completely stops beating. It just means that a person&rsquo;s
   heart isn&rsquo;t pumping blood as well as it should be. As a result,
   the body doesn&rsquo;t get enough oxygen since it&rsquo;s carried to
   all the tissues by the blood.</p> <p><strong>Nausea and loss of
   appetite</strong>. A lot of heart disease patients show a lack of
   appetite, nausea, or both, even if they&rsquo;ve had just a couple
   bites of food. The reason for that is built-up fluid around the liver
   and intestines that interferes with proper digestion. These symptoms
   are usually accompanied by abdominal pain, upset stomach, or feeling
   bloated. In fact, abdominal cramps that come and go in short spurts are
   extremely common right before a heart attack.</p> <p><strong>Your skin
   becomes paler or takes on a bluish tint.</strong> Being naturally pale
   doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have a heart condition. But sudden
   paleness can be a result of reduced blood flow due to a heart
   that&rsquo;s not pumping blood as effectively as it should be. Shock,
   which can be caused by any condition that prevents the blood in your
   body from circulating properly, is the main reason why people who are
   suffering from a heart attack or heart failure turn pale all of a
   sudden.</p> <p><strong>Chronic or sudden fatigue.</strong> Fatigue can
   be one of the main symptoms indicating an impending heart attack. Women
   are more likely to experience heart-related fatigue than men, with 70%
   of female heart attack patients reporting that they&rsquo;d felt
   extremely tired before their episode. Physical or mental activity
   isn&rsquo;t the reason for such exhaustion, and it increases by the end
   of the day if it&rsquo;s due to a failing heart. It&rsquo;s really hard
   for this symptom to go unnoticed. Sometimes it&rsquo;s exhausting just
   to perform even the simplest tasks, like making the bed or taking a
   shower.</p> <p><strong>Pain that spreads to the arm.</strong>&nbsp;If
   their heart isn&rsquo;t working properly, a lot of men feel pain in
   their left arm, while women experience the same pain in either or both
   arms.</p> <p><strong>Swollen legs, ankles, and feet.</strong>&nbsp;When
   your heart isn&rsquo;t pumping enough blood through the body, fluid
   from your blood vessels leaks into surrounding tissues. Your lower
   extremities are the most affected simply due to gravity.</p>
   <p><strong>Extreme levels of anxiety.</strong>&nbsp;People who suffer
   from extreme anxiety from a very early age or most of their life are
   more prone to developing coronary heart disease.</p> <p><strong>Light
   headness or fainting</strong>.&nbsp;Feeling lightheaded and
   experiencing temporary loss of consciousness, also known in the
   scientific community as &ldquo;syncope&rdquo;, is super common among
   heart patients.</p> <p><strong>Skin rashes or unusual
   spots.</strong>&nbsp;People with eczema were found to have a 48% chance
   of suffering from high blood pressure and a 29% possibility of having
   high cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>Increased
   perspiration.</strong>&nbsp;People experience flu-like symptoms, have
   clammy skin, and sweat regardless of the air temperature or physical
   exertion.</p> <p>Talk to your physician if you have any of these
   symptoms.</p> <p>Watch Video:</p> <p><iframe width="890" height="501"

   600px"></p> <p>How to clean your BBQ grill. The best way to clean your
   charcoal and gas grill.</p> <p><b>Safety:&nbsp;</b>When cleaning grills
   with bristle brushes, always thoroughly wipe down the cleaned area
   afterwards in order to remove any bristles that may have come off
   during the cleaning process and stuck to the grill. Also, cleaning
   while the grilling surface is warm can make the job easier, but
   remember to wait until the surface has cooled enough that it will not
   burn you.</p> <p><strong>To clean a charcoal grill you will
   need:</strong></p> <ul class="list list--type-plain u__text-align--left
   "> <li class="list__item list__item--padding-none ">Long-handled
   stiff-wire grill brush</li> <li class="list__item
   list__item--padding-none ">Paper towels</li> <li class="list__item
   list__item--padding-none ">Dawn Dish detergent</li> <li
   class="list__item list__item--padding-none ">Vegetable oil</li> <li
   class="list__item list__item--padding-none ">Rags</li> <li>Watch video
   below for instructions</li> </ul> <p><strong>Instruction to clean a gas
   grill:</strong></p> <ul class="list u__text-align--left "> <li
   class="list__item ">Pre-heat the grill for 15 minutes on high heat then
   turn off the grill. &bull; Turn the gas off &ndash; either on the
   propane tank or the gas line.</li> <li class="list__item ">Clean the
   grill using a stiff wire brush dipped in water. Do not lean over the
   grill while cleaning, as this should create plenty of steam.</li> <li
   class="list__item ">For tough grease spots, add Dawn dish soap to the
   water or a grill cleaner.</li> <li class="list__item ">Once the surface
   has cooled, wipe the grate with a damp cloth to remove residue or brush
   bristles.</li> <li class="list__item ">Remove burners from the gas
   supply line and remove blockages to the burner&rsquo;s gas ports using
   a dry wire brush. Clean the ports by brushing side-to-side instead of
   up-and-down, as the vertical motion may push debris into the
   ports.</li> <li class="list__item ">Clean the burner valve with soapy
   water and run water through the inside of the valve.</li> <li
   class="list__item ">Clean the inside of of the grill using a wire brush
   and warm soapy water and rinse with water. Towel dry the burners and
   reinstall.</li> <li class="list__item ">When washing the outside of a
   stainless steel grill, use a specially formulated stainless steel
   cleaner and micro fiber cloth. Ceramic, porcelain and painted steel
   surfaces can be cleaned using soap and water.</li> <li
   class="list__item ">If you have a propane grill, you can store it
   outside with the propane tank attached. If storing inside, remove the

   time.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a definite art to picking the very best
   watermelons. It involves weighing the watermelon between your hands,
   turning it over, and giving it a firm&nbsp;<em>thwap!</em>&nbsp;on the
   underside. Why? A heavy watermelon with a splotch on its belly and a
   hollow sound means it is brimming with juice and at the peak of its
   ripeness.</p> <ol class="X5LH0c"> <li class="TrT0Xe">Ripe melons have a
   hollow sound when you tap or slap the outside.&nbsp;A watermelon is
   ripe when you hear &ldquo;punk&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;pank&rdquo; or
   &ldquo;pink&rdquo; when you tap it with your finger.</li> <li
   class="TrT0Xe">It should feel relatively heavy when lifted.</li>
   <li>Make sure it has a prominent yellow spot. This is where it sat on
   the ground ripening. No spot = premature pick = not ripe.</li> <li>Look
   for &ldquo;webbing&rdquo;. This is the brown, course web looking
   materiel. This is caused when bees pollinate the flower and scar the
   membranes that later forms the fruit. The more pollination = more
   webbing = sweeter fruit.</li> <li>Shake it. If you hear things moving
   inside, it&rsquo;s overly ripe.</li> </ol> <p></body></html></p> <div

   600px"></p> <p>With the right stimulation, your brain can form new
   neural pathways, alter existing connections, and adapt and react in
   ever-changing ways.&nbsp;Fuzzy thinking and memory loss is a normal
   part of aging. But behavioral strategies and memory-enhancing
   techniques can help improve the ability to learn new information and
   retain it over time.</p> <p><strong>Give your brain a
   boost:</strong>&nbsp;Think of something new you&rsquo;ve always wanted
   to try, like learning how to play the guitar, make pottery, juggle,
   play chess, speak French, dance the tango, or master your golf swing.
   Any of these activities can help you improve your memory, so long as
   they keep you challenged and engaged.&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t
   sufficiently challenge your brain with new, surprising information, it
   eventually begins to deteriorate.</p>
   <p><strong>Exercise:&nbsp;</strong>Aerobic exercise is particularly
   good for the brain, so choose activities that keep your blood pumping.
   In general, anything that is good for your heart is great for your
   brain.</p> <p><strong>Socialize:</strong>&nbsp;Humans are highly social
   animals. We&rsquo;re not meant to survive, let alone thrive, in
   isolation. Relationships stimulate our brains&mdash;in fact,
   interacting with others may be the best kind of brain
   exercise.&nbsp;Studies have indicted that caring for a dog, creating
   art, and spending time with a grandchild can boost different aspects of
   memory and reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Laugh:&nbsp;</strong>Share your
   embarrassing moments. The best way to take ourselves less seriously is
   to talk about the times when we took ourselves too
   seriously.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve heard that&nbsp;laughter is the best
   medicine, and that holds true for the brain and the memory, as well as
   the body. Unlike emotional responses, which are limited to specific
   areas of the brain, laughter engages multiple regions across the whole
   brain.</p> <p><strong>Read a book:</strong>&nbsp;An analysis of records
   of 5,635 participants in the Health and Retirement Study linked regular
   book reading with a 20% reduced risk of dying over a 12-year
   period.</p> <p><strong>Take care of your
   teeth</strong>:&nbsp;Periodontal disease, the leading cause of adult
   tooth loss, is an inflammatory condition that may increase the risk of
   diabetes, heart disease, and dementia. The best defenses are regular
   brushing and flossing, along with not smoking.</p> <p><strong>Listen to
   music:</strong>&nbsp;Music aids formation and recovery of memory.</p>
   <p><strong>Use tools:</strong>&nbsp;Using tools such as calendars,
   cellphone alarms, and organizing apps can aid with memory.&nbsp;Have
   one central place to jot down important appointments, to-dos, and
   notes. If you&rsquo;re tech savvy, that can be a smartphone app. Or,
   you can use an old-fashioned paper organizer, calendar, or notebook.
   You can even put up an erasable board in your kitchen to write down
   items. Use an address book.&nbsp;Jot down the names, addresses, and
   phone numbers you need&mdash;including those of family, friends, your
   doctors, and the companies with which you do business (bank, dry
   cleaner, mechanic, etc.). Keep them together in a paper book or use the
   contacts tool on your computer or phone, and update them as needed.</p>
   <p><strong>Get enough sleep:</strong>&nbsp;When people don&rsquo;t get
   enough sleep, their attention and concentration abilities decline.
   Their reaction time lengthens, they&rsquo;re inattentive, and they
   don&rsquo;t respond as well to&nbsp;environmental signals. That means
   they can&rsquo;t take in new information or react to dangerous
   situations. But people can make up for lost sleep and restore focus and
   clarity by seeing a doctor about a possible underlying cause of sleep
   trouble, seeing a sleep specialist, cutting out caffeine and foods that
   cause heartburn, practicing good sleep hygiene, and exercising earlier
   in the day.</p> <p><strong>Mediate:</strong>&nbsp;Meditation&nbsp;can
   increase&nbsp;blood&nbsp;flow in the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;and improve
   memory, according to researchers who tested a specific kind of
   meditation and found the improvement after just eight weeks. Read about

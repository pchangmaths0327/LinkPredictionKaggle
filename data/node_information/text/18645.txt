   CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY, Before I turn to the importance of seeking new
   ways to finance quality education, Iâ€™d like to illustrate why education
   is so important â€” for children of all ages, no matter where they live.
     Last year I travelled to a small village in India â€” Mirzapur, in
   Uttar Pradesh. I visited an Aanganwadi. Itâ€™s one of several rural child

   UNICEF cookies policy


UNICEF cookies policy

   By visiting or using this website, a cookie will be created which
   UNICEF may use to provide statistics that help us to give you the best
   experience of our sites. The statement below describes our policy on
   cookies.

   If you do not agree with any of the following, you can switch off the
   cookies. However, by continuing to use our sites without changing
   settings, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.

   What is a cookie?

   During the course of any visit to our websites, the pages which you
   see, along with something called a cookie, are downloaded to your
   computer. Most, if not all, websites do this, and thatâ€™s because
   cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out
   whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site
   before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding,
   the cookie left there on the last visit.

   So â€“ what is a cookie? When you enter a site your computer will
   automatically be issued with a cookie. Cookies are text files which
   identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not
   identify the individual user, just the computer used. Many sites do
   this whenever a user visits their site, in order to track traffic
   flows. Cookies themselves only record which areas of the site have been
   visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the
   opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify
   them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time,
   although this of course means that certain personalised services cannot
   then be provided to that user. You should read the information that
   came with your browser software to see how you can do this. Even
   assuming you have not set your computer to reject cookies, you can
   browse our sites anonymously until such time as you register your
   information with UNICEF.

   What do cookies tell us?

   We use cookies to collect data for analytics, such as demographic and
   interest data, based on your browsing patterns. This data allows us to
   estimate your age range, your gender and things that might interest
   you.

   What do we use cookies for?

   We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you
   return to our websites. In particular, we use cookies to:
     * better understand our audience and supporters, for example by
       estimating our audience size and patterns and tracking the level of
       interest in our campaigns;
     * track your preferences and personalise the sites to your
       requirements and interests. For example: if on a previous visit you
       went to, say, the [Imagine Campaign] pages, then we might find this
       out from your cookie and highlight particular information â€“ which
       you may find interesting, on a second visit;
     * avoid lengthy registration/personalisation on each visit;
     * display relevant promotion, communications and appeals on other
       websites you visit;
     * improve and update our websites.

   How do we collect and analyze cookies?

   UNICEF does not collect and analyze the data to create cookies
   directly; we use a specialist service provider which both collects
   information on your preferences from your visits to our websites and
   analyzes your preferences from cookies already stored in your browser.

   We obtain this information by enabling Google Analytics to analyze the
   traffic on our websites via "Google Advertising Cookies". Google
   Advertising Cookies are a series of cookies already stored in your
   browser that compile data from your browsing preferences. You can see
   the types of cookies used by Google and learn more about the different
   categories in the Google Privacy & terms.

   We may change our specialist service provider at any time without
   notice to you and will update this Policy as necessary at that time.

   What can you do if you do not want us to use your cookies?
     * Configure how we use your Google Analytics information.
     * If you would like to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking
       services then you can install an Add-on. Find out about more about
       Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
     * Alternatively, you can use your browsersâ€™ private browsing mode.
       Common browsers like Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer
       have this functionality.

   How do I opt-out of the collection and use of information for
   promotional purposes generally?

   There are many websites that provide guidance on how to opt out of the
   collection and use of your information for promotional purposes that
   are not limited to UNICEF web properties. For example:
     * Google Ads settings
     * Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page
     * Digital Advertising Allianceâ€™s Consumer Choice Tool

   Do you share data from cookies with other organizations?

   We may share your data from your cookies with partners, agents or
   service providers to understand our supporters more effectively and to
   further UNICEFâ€™s mission.

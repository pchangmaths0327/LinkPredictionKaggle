   Lessons You Can Take From Them

   "Have you ever had one of these RXBARs?" I asked the cashier as I was
   checking out.

   "I actually haven't, but man do they sell. People here love it and buy
   it all the time," the cashier said.

   I had just finished interviewing co-founder of   RXBAR, Peter Rahal at
   his local coffee shop in the River North neighborhood of Chicago.

   Three weeks prior, Rahal and his partner Jared Smith sold their company
   to Kellogg's for $600 million.

   No venture capital or outside funding--just $5,000 invested by each
   founder.

   The rest is history. Here's what I learned from Rahal.

You don't need investors to build a multimillion-dollar company

   "I remember distinctly early in my business when I was asking my dad
   about all the investor money I needed to fulfill my vision for RXBAR.
   He told me very directly, 'You need to shut up and sell 1,000 bars.'"

   That's all Rahal needed to hear. He started walking door to door to
   coffee shops and cross-fit centers in his neighborhood.

   "We would ask to speak to the owner and ask if we could put my bars on
   their shelves. we gave it away for free. We didn't care. We just wanted
   people to start trying them out. We made these bars by hand. There was
   no huge manufacturing line. It was one bar at a time.

   It actually made our due diligence with Kellogg really smooth. We had a
   clean cap table. We were open books with them. Everything they wanted
   to know, we had answers for them," Rahal said.

Iterate and learn

   The first RXBAR packaging was built in PowerPoint.

   "I'm not a designer, but Jared and I knew that we needed to get to
   market as soon as possible, so we opened up PowerPoint and created the
   best packaging we could. I even put my cell phone number on the
   package. I wanted to make sure I was accessible as possible. Feedback
   is how we grew," Rahal said. "We knew we were on to something pretty
   quickly. We went all-in [and] quit our day jobs. [We] moved our
   operations from mom's basement and rented a small production space."

   After 5 iterations of packaging:

Believe in what you're selling

   We were sick of all these weak ingredients in protein bars. That's when
   we decided to make something that was transparent. We knew the market
   wanted something like this. That's why we put our core ingredients on
   the package. It really is 'no B.S.'"

   One thing we say is, "We tell you what's on the inside on the
   outside."

   I have to say that's probably one of the best brand promises I've heard
   in a long time.

Embrace your differences

   "My partner Jared and I are very different. It's a big reason why he's
   been so crucial to the success of this business. I honestly don't think
   we would be in business if it wasn't for him. He enabled us to grow at
   the pace we are growing, without raising any capital."

   "We had manufacturing and distribution constraints, but we each played
   a role in solving problems."

   "These constraints helped us stay honest with ourselves," says Rahal.

Culture is everything

   "I don't have a corner office. I sit with everyone else. I actually
   take most of my calls on speakerphone. I want to set the tone that I
   have nothing to hide and that we're all in this together," Rahal said.

   He also implemented dynamic job descriptions for his employees.

   "Considering the growth we had in a short time frame, it's important
   that the roles of our team members change as we grow. Just because you
   are responsible for one thing when you got hired, doesn't mean that
   there aren't other roles you can grow into. I made sure that was clear
   from day one."

Just because you sold the company, doesn't mean your work is done

   "Some people might be surprised that I'm still working, but I love it.
   Also, you don't sell your company and have less work. That's not how
   this works! In many respects, we just got started. I still have a great
   job."

   "We picked [Kellogg's] as a partner, because we felt they really
   understood our business, our vision and most importantly, I learned
   something from them every conversation I had."

   Warren Buffett Looks for Intelligence and Initiative When Hiring
   People. But Without This Third Trait, 'the First Two Will Kill You'

Do you ever base your hiring decisions on this? You should.

   Billionaire Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway,
   still captures the world's attention with his wisdom, even at the
   youthful age of 88.

   Buffett's commonsense wisdom stretches far beyond wealth and investment
   to decisions that could make or break your very livelihood, or the
   livelihood of your organization.

   Like, for example, a company's hiring decisions. In respect to this
   topic, the mega-mogul said:

     We look for three things when we hire people. We look for
     intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for
     integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will
     kill you, because if you're going to get someone without integrity,
     you want them lazy and dumb.

   So, who wants to hire a dumb and lazy person, raise your hand?
   Integrity is a personal value that should be explored in-depth but is
   often overlooked in interviews, which can be costly later, especially
   in the upper levels of a company's hierarchy.

Why integrity is so crucial for success.

   When we arrive at the difficult crossroads of life, even the smallest
   action can ruin your reputation and trigger an avalanche of unfortunate
   incidents that may be out of your control.

   That's when integrity shows its best side. As the famous saying goes,
   we act with integrity by always doing the right thing, even when no one
   is looking, and especially when the choice isn't easy.

   I'll close with seven reasons why you should consider making your most
   important decisions at work with integrity, and, more important, why
   you should always bank on hiring people with integrity to take your
   company to the next level.

1. You don't question yourself; other people don't question you.

   Life is simplified and more peaceful when you do the right thing and
   speak in honesty and truth. And when you back up your words with
   actions that are consistent, and your actions are open for everyone to
   see, people don't question whether you're hiding anything.

2. You gain trust.

   Integrity leads to trust. People working closest to you experience you
   as dependable and accountable for your actions. Trust develops, people
   feel safe in your presence, and you gain influence.

3. You command respect.

   Integrity is a hallmark of ethical leadership. And when you demonstrate
   integrity, others will naturally respond to your ethical leadership
   with great respect.

4. You give and keep promises.

   People with integrity give promises, even reluctantly. But once they
   do, they always follow through on that promise without fail.

5. You don't cheat.

   Remember Enron? That company was once called one of the most innovative
   in the country. But their CEO and top management team decided to
   build their success on a foundation of lies and deception. You know how
   that story ended.

6. You don't betray others.

   People who act in integrity don't betray themselves or others by using
   words or making decisions not aligned with who they truly are. It's
   highly unlikely that you will hear such a person being talked about for
   "throwing someone under the bus."

7. You're given more responsibilities.

   Because a person of integrity is responsible (and does the right
   thing), managers will give them higher levels of responsibilities,
   which can increase skills and advance careers.
